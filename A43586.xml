            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief.</hi> Which contains the Summ and Subſtance of our Chriſtian Faith, the Marrow of the Goſpel, the Quinteſcence of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: nor doth any Miniſter need to be <hi>aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for it is the Power of God to Salvation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It's true, it is ſimply and plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſt, not with Ornaments of Art or Rhetorical Flouriſhes to ſet it off to the Learned, being calculated in intelligible Language to vulgar Capacities, and poſſibly it may prove more profitable to Country Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: nor ought it to offend any, that much of this Treatiſe is in Scripture dialect in words, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt teacheth, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>2.13. which the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Man cannot but approve, and Love.</hi>

               </gap> next: Things will not then be carried as they are now. Deal faithfully with God and your own Souls; ſee you have the Root of the Matter, the Life of Grace: you may herd amongſt the Sheep now, and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:37116:4"/>be found amongſt Goats at laſt. A King will give his Subjects liberty to travel into another King's Dominions, reſerving their Loyalty to their own King: <hi>Papiſts</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> days, being commanded to go to Church, or be puniſhed, ſent to the Pope for a Reſolution of this Caſe of Conſcience: His Anſwer was, They might comply; but <hi>Fili, da mihi cor, My Son, give me thy Heart:</hi> Thus the Devil will give you leave to read, pray, hear, receive, attend on Ordinances; but as long as he hath you fast by the Heart-ſtrings, you are still his Slaves, none of God's Servants: for the Soul is the Man: <hi>As a man thinketh in his Heart, ſo is he,</hi> Prov. <hi>23.7.</hi> As a man's Principles are ſtated, ſo he receives his denomination, a good or a bad, a Jew, or an Heathen; a Saint or a Bruit. If you have a Beaſt's Heart in the ſhape of a Man, God will eſteem you no better than a Beaſt. And it's an uſual Saying, <hi>It is better be a Beaſt, than be like a Beaſt.</hi> It is the Saying of a Learned Man. <hi>Some make the Image of the Living God hewn out of the Stock of a dead Tree: But the New Creature is not ſuch a lifeleſs thing as many ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine:</hi> It is the Spirit of <hi>power, of love, and of a ſound mind,

               </gap>, certainly this vital Principle hath ſtrong and vigorous motions God-wards, and againſt Sin; Its an holy Spark, working upwards to God, and forwards streight for Heaven: Moſt Profeſſors are miſtaken in this great Work; though Miniſters are oft calling on you Sinners to look about
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:37116:4"/>you, we tell you, there's a Cheat in the caſe, Satan is buſie to lay his Brats in God's Bed. Counterfeit Coin is common; our Warnings now will be thought of, theſe frequent Summons will ring in your Ears, our Sermons will have a Repetition in this, or in another world: Conſcience will gall you, and you cannot plead Ignorance, or ſay, <hi>[non putâram]</hi> I thought not of ſuch a day. How often do we tell you of the danger of dying in your old ſtate, and of that Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous Lake, that thouſands are ſcolded in that once lived as ſecurely as you now do, and they are in an hopeleſs, helpleſs Eternity; and how can you tell but this may be the last day? the laſt warning or overture of Grace, the last knock at your Door? God may ſay, <hi>Away, be gone out of my ſight, take him, Devil, I will no more be troubled with ſuch a Miſcreant.</hi> But if after all this, you be ſenceleſs, and lie ſtill while you are nailed in your Coffin, you are dead, twice dead; and this Security is a confutation of that Principle, that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity by the Fall, is not dead, but ſleepeth, or only in a ſwound and languor, but life is in him: No, no, this ſad <hi>Stupor</hi> or Spiritual Lethargy, ſhews it's not an excitation of a principle, but an infuſion of new Life: all our ſhouting, and rubbing, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will not recover Sinners; we muſt leave them to a creating Power, and to him that can raiſe the Dead.</p>
            <p>But let me rather perſuade you to look after this New-Creation-Work, from the Advantage it will be to all ſorts of Perſons, of every Age and Relation.</p>
            <p>Oh! you Old Perſons, that are going off the Stage of the World, dropping into the Grave and Eternity, that have been long, and not yet lived, begin at laſt to turn over a new leaf, ſeek a New Life, that you may have Comfort, and not terrour in your expiring
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:37116:5"/>Pangs: yet there is hope, God ſtill waits to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and ſtands knocking at your Door; riſe out of your Bed of ſloth, put back the Barr, admit him with all his Graces; make out for this Change, againſt your laſt Change.</p>
            <p>You Young People, that have lately ſtep'd into the World, and ſlip'd thus far before you know where you are, it may be, young in Years, old in Sin, you are entring into a wicked world, with wicked hearts, Oh! look after this bleſſed Antidote, that may prevent Infection; be ſure of a Pilot that may row you through this boiſterous Sea ſafe to the Haven: without new hearts you will make this bad World worſe, and be worſe by it; rather ſeek to amend it.</p>
            <p>You that are entring into Callings, or for changing Conditions, you will be fit for nothing without this; you will bring a Curſe into every Relation, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation without this: but this will make you fit for any thing, and you will be attended with God's Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, in all you ſet about.</p>
            <p>You Married Perſons, I recommend this New Creature to you, that you be ſure <hi>to marry in the Lord,</hi> then you will be <hi>Heirs together of the Grace of Life:</hi> and pray, praiſe God together, have this ſweet Relation perfum'd, and meet in Glory.</p>
            <p>You Rich Perſons are Beggars without this; this will make you rich and honourable, the excellent in the Earth, God's Jewels, Favourites of Heaven. And you poor, that cannot get daily Bread, this will make you rich in Faith, Heirs of a Kingdom: Oh what a Treaſure is this fear of the Lord!</p>
            <p>You poor Athenians, that are always inquiring after News, new Opinions, new Inventions, new Faſhions, here's a brave and bleſſed piece of Novelty for you; this New Creature will ſtand you
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:37116:5"/>in ſtead, not ſo much to pleaſe your itching Ears, as to profit your Languiſhing Souls.</p>
            <p>Well, I have done my poor Endeavour, to effect this work upon your Hearts.

O that Corruption may be mortified, Satan caſt out, a ſound Principle introduced, the Soul redintegrated, and everlaſtingly ſaved.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>The Text opened, a Doctrine raiſed, and handled.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOme Interpreters think that this Text comes not in, ſo much as a proof of the Aſſertion immediately preceding of the Apoſtle's <hi>glorying in Chriſt's Croſs, and his being cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified to the world,</hi> ver. 14. As it is a concluſion of the main Doctrine delivered in this Epiſtle, viz. <hi>That a Sinner is not juſtified by the Law, but by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> q. d. <hi>[hoc eſt quod dico et repeto, et extremis verbis contendo]</hi> I urge this firſt and laſt with the greateſt ardour and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, let <hi>Jews</hi> and Judaizing <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſay what they will or can, this I reſolutely affirm, that now in the Goſpel-ſtate, as ſettled by Chriſt, it is of no great moment, whether a Man be a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Gentile:</hi> It's true, under, the Law there was ſomething of privilege in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as it was a badge of God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and the Uncircumciſed were Strangers to the Covenants of Promiſe, and had no right to Church-Memberſhip, but now in the Goſpel, God is the God of the believing <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for there is not
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:37116:7"/>one God in the Old Teſtament, and another in the New, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> dream'd, but <hi>it is one God, that ſhall juſtifie the Circumciſion by Faith, and Uncircumciſion through Faith,</hi> Rom. 3.29, 30. i. e. both one way, ſo they be ſincere Saints, for God regards not any for being Circumciſed, nor rejects any for the want of it, but looks at real Sanctification of Heart and Life.</p>
               <p>This is a ſound and appoſite dependance of the words; but <hi>Calvin</hi> adjoyns them to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſe. The Reaſon why the bleſſed Apoſtle is crucified to the World, and the World to him, is becauſe in Chriſt (in whom he is planted) the chief thing available, is a New Creature; other things are inſignificant: the truth of this the Apoſtle had before demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated <hi>[quia Scilicet, veritas Evangelij omnes le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis figuras abſorbeat, &amp; exinaniat]</hi> becauſe the Goſpel-Truth makes void legal Figures: ſo both Interpretations come to one.</p>
               <p>It's obſervable that this Phraſe is three times uſed, with different Concluſions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19. <hi>Circumciſion is nothing, and Uncircumciſion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but the keeping of the Commandments of God.</hi> Again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. <hi>For in Jeſus Chriſt neither Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion availeth any thing, nor Uncircumciſion, but Faith which worketh by Love.</hi> And in this Text, <hi>But a New Creature:</hi> They all conſpire in this one Sence, That in this New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Diſpenſation by Chriſt, no Privileges are efficacious to the Salvation of a Soul, without a working Faith accompanied with a Principle of Grace in the Heart, and an Holy Life, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Rule of God's holy Word:
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:37116:7"/>thus there's a due conſiſtency in theſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Qualifications: for in Spiritual Means, Marks, Methods of Salvation, there is a bleſſed Combination, Confederacy and Concatena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: not a Link of this Golden Chain can be wanting: the true Religion is of one piece, there's no looſe Joynt, but all the parts make up one entire Body and compleat Syſtem of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But to come to the Words, in which we have the negative and poſitive parts of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: wherein it doth not conſiſt, and wherein it doth: Suppoſe Men had excellent Privileges, and choice Advantages, theſe would not of themſelves attain the Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> God's glory and Man's happineſs.</p>
               <p>By this Word, [in Chriſt Jeſus] ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the Chriſtian Religion, others in the Church or Kingdom of Chriſt, others in the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, <hi>[in negotio ſalutis obtinendae per Chriſtum]</hi> in the buſineſs of obtaining Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel is called the Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. wherein, and whereby the Glorious deſign of ſaving Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt, doth eminently and evidently appear, called <hi>the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>And he hath brought life and immortality to light by the Goſpel;</hi> or through the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p>Circumciſion was to the <hi>Jews</hi> a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. a Badge and Cognizance, whereby an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from other People, to be God's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37116:8"/>peculiar Heritage: it both ingaged to Duty, and entailed many Privileges: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.4.</p>
               <p>By its not availing any thing, is ſignified its ineffectualneſs to attain theſe two great Ends: 1. The juſtifying of a Sinner before God: 2. The Salvation of a Soul with God: not that I think the New Creature juſtifies, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter, but it is in a juſtified Perſon, and theſe external Privileges avail not to our Juſtification, and the want of them hinders not; but in this caſe, <hi>there is neither Greek, nor Jew, Circumciſion nor Uncircumciſion, Barbarian, Scythian, Bond nor Free, but Chriſt is all, and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. Hence obſerve.</p>
               <p>Doctrine 1. <hi>That the richest Privileges and moſt glorious Profeſſions, avail no Man without a New Creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> boaſted of their Privileges, and by conſequence Goſpel-Profeſſours, are apt to bear themſelves big with what they think to be of great worth, but they all ſignifie nothing in the ſight of God, if they be not New Creatures: Men may pleaſe themſelves with external Shews, Profeſſions, Privileges, as to be born of Godly Parents, to be baptized, living under pure and powerful Ordinances, aſſociating with the beſt Saints in the pureſt Churches, ſitting down at the Lord's Supper, making credible Profeſſion, performing Religious Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; yea, ſuffering much for the Religion of God; all theſe together will not avail a Soul, in order to his Eternal Happineſs, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a New Creature: miſtake me not, I do not ſay, but theſe are good in their places, and great Mercies and Duties.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37116:8"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerve</hi> 1. <hi>Things</hi> that hinder or oppoſe the New Creature, are hurtful in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and to be laid aſide, as Sin and the Old Man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Things</hi> that further not this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in our Hearts, are comparatively uſeleſs, though lawful, as the Profits, Pleaſures, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Things</hi> that do further the Work of the New Creature by God's appointment, are not of themſelves ſufficient to attain their End, without the concurrence of divine Grace; as Preaching, Prayer, Seals, they are but means.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Things</hi> good in themſelves may, by man's abuſe, prove rather Snares and Hindrances, then Helps and Furtherances in Heaven's Road; Circumciſion was once good and God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but when ſome Judaizers affirmed, that <hi>except Chriſtians were Circumciſed after the manner of</hi> Moſes, <hi>they could not be ſaved,</hi> Acts 15.1, 9, 10. The Apoſtles determine the point, ſaying, <hi>that God put no difference between Jews and Gentiles;</hi> and this <hi>was a Yoke that neither they nor their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were able to bear:</hi> and ſo it was not only laid aſide as other legal Ceremonies, which became not only [<hi>mortuae,</hi> but <hi>mortiferae</hi>] dead, but deadly; ſo the Apoſtle affirms, <hi>that if ye be circumciſed, Chriſt ſhall profit you nothing,</hi> Gal. 5.2. Nay, the beſt Duties, Ordinances, Privileges, reſted in ſhort of Chriſt, will rather ruin, then raiſe us; undo us, than endow us with Grace here, or glory hereafter: ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32.10.3.</p>
               <p>But this is a great Truth, that all the Privileges
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37116:9"/>in the world without this New Creature, can never of themſelves render a Soul acceptable to God, or bring it to eternal happineſs in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſuch a Perſon may be, and is in the Old <hi>Adam,</hi> and is yet under the Old Covenant, which brings a Curſe, and being out of Chriſt, (the Second <hi>Adam) Gal.</hi> 3.10-13. All that he hath, doth, enjoyeth, is accurſed to him; for every man muſt either keep the Law, and ſatisfie for the breach of it in his own Perſon; or another, that is able, muſt do it for him, and that's none but Chriſt our Surety; and Chrſt doth it not for any but ſuch as by Faith have intereſt in him; now he that is not a New Creature, hath no intereſt in Chriſt, <hi>for if any man be in Chriſt,</hi> (i. e. related to Chriſt, intitled to him) <hi>he is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. And he that is not graffed in this true Vine, and doth not <hi>partake of the root and fatneſs of this Olive-tree,</hi> can bear no Fruit, <hi>John</hi> 15.1, 5. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. Do nothing to any purpoſe, nor improve any Privilege to his Spiritual profit, for he is a dead Branch caſt forth and withered, and caſt into the Fire, <hi>John</hi> 15.6. Though he was in Chriſt by Profeſſion, yet becauſe he was not planted in Chriſt, by poſſeſſion of him, he is a woful caſt-away: he is graffed in a wrong Stock, to be fruitful here, or to ſhoot up as high as Heaven at laſt: now we cannot be accepted but in the beloved, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. And without Faith in Chriſt it's impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. for <hi>the first man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living Soul,</hi> [and by his Fall, himſelf and his Poſterity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37116:9"/>are become dead, condemned Sinners] <hi>but the last</hi> Adam <hi>is made a quickning Spirit.</hi> [i. e. Chriſt becomes a Principle of Life to all his Spiritual Offspring] and he will own none but ſuch: ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45, 49.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſuch Souls want the ſanctifying operations of the Holy Ghoſt: and we find that <hi>the offering up of the Gentiles, is only acceptable, by being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15.16. God will own nothing from Men, but what hath the Breathings of the Spirit in it: <hi>For God knoweth the Mind of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.26, 27. The leaſt interpellations thereof in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though but a groaning that cannot be uttered, is accepted by God; but the moſt eloquent Rhapſodies, and loudeſt Vociferations of graceleſs Souls, are rejected by the Lord; <hi>For if any man have not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9, 11, 14. Here we read of the Spirit of God dwelling in Believers: and <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they</hi> (and indeed none elſe) <hi>are the Sons of God.</hi> God will own none for his, but them that have this ſtamp, this ſeal upon them; ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22. <hi>VVho hath alſo ſealed us, and given the earneſt of the Spirit in our Hearts:</hi> and this is the <hi>Earneſt of our Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> Epheſ. 1.13, 14. Now all external Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Privileges and Performances, amount not to this: and the Scripture tells us, that <hi>He is not a Jew</hi> (i. e. a ſincere Chriſtian; for its an Old-Teſtament Title, given to a New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Saint) <hi>that is one outwardly; neither is that Circumciſion which is outward in the Fleſh, but he is a Jew which is one inwardly, and Circumciſion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37116:10"/>is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, and not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.28, 29. There lies the Life and Vitals of our Religion; the Tree muſt firſt be good, or it can never bring forth good Fruit: <hi>[Operari ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Eſſe];</hi> working attends the being of a thing. If men be not good, they can never do good: now it is not any thing External, that can make Perſons good, it muſt be <hi>the hidden man of the Heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. that conſtitutes a Perſon good. So Reaſon makes a Man, not Jewels, or outward Ornaments; thus Grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes a Chriſtian, not outward Privileges. As nothing that is <hi>without a man, can defile a man,</hi> Mark 15. So nothing without can cleanſe him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall briefly apply this point, and ſo paſs to the next</p>
               <p>Is this ſo, That the Richeſt Privileges, and moſt Glorious Profeſſions, avail not any Man, except he be a New Creature? Then,</p>
               <p>It follows, that Religion conſiſts not in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, but Poſitives: Its falſe arguing to ſay, I am not a <hi>Jew,</hi> not a <hi>Turk,</hi> no <hi>Heathen,</hi> and therefore a good <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> nay, its not enough to ſay I am no Swearer, Drunkard, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogner, therefore a Saint good enough; this was the Fallacy of the Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.11. <hi>God I thank thee, that I am not as other men, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioners, Unjust, Adulterers,</hi> or <hi>even as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> Alas this would not do; God diſowned him: Chriſtianity conſiſts in ſomething poſitive, <hi>Little Children,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, he that doth righteouſneſs is righteous, even
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:37116:10"/>as he is righteous,</hi> 1 John 3.7. <hi>Chriſt became the Author of Eternal Salvation unto all them</hi> (and only them) <hi>that obey him,</hi> Heb 5.9. Alas! Perſons may gull and beguil themſelves with airy Notions and Speculations of free Grace, Chriſt's merits, and truſting God, and ſo build Caſtles in the Air, which will drop with them into Hell; for without practical Godlineſs, they will be deceived, and die with a Lye in their Right Hand. Miſtake not, I ſay not that free Grace, or Chriſt's Blood, is but a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, or that a Soul can be ſaved without them, or that he that believeth (with a Goſpel ſincere Faith) ſhall miſs of Heaven, but many ſnatch at theſe, and eſpouſe a meer <hi>Chimaera,</hi> a Fancy or Notion of theſe, while they have not a Principle in their Hearts, or the Power of Godlineſs in their Lives. I may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Can Faith ſave thee? No, no,</hi> ſuch a <hi>Faith without Works is dead,</hi> James 2.4, 20. And being lifeleſs, 'tis loſt, thou muſt have ſomething that hath exiſtence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Chriſtianity doth not lie in meer Externals: If men have no more Religion then is viſible to others, they have not that which will ſerve their turn: true Godlineſs is a hidden myſtical thing, <hi>Our Life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. Its a Pearl in the Shell, its an hidden Spring that moves the viſible Hand: God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are <hi>hidden Ones,</hi> Pſal. 83. King's in a diſguiſe, <hi>It appears not yet what they ſhall be,</hi> 1 John 3.2. The beſt and worſt of a real Saint is not obvious to mens view: <hi>The King's Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is all glorious within,</hi> Pſal. 45.13. If Privileges
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:37116:11"/>and Profeſſion did denominate a Saint, we might infallibly tell who ſhould be ſaved; but a Child of God hath two ſides, one God-wards, another Men-wards. A Merchant's Wares are in back Shops: the beſt Goods are often under Deck. <hi>In the hidden parts,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>thou ſhalt make me to know VViſdom,</hi> Pſal 51.6. Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites are <hi>painted Sepulchres,</hi> that <hi>outwardly appear beautiful,</hi> but <hi>within are full of dead mens Bones, and of all uncleanneſs,</hi> Mat. 23.27. You muſt look at Internal Principles, not at exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Profeſſions or Privileges.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is ſuch a thing as Nominal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Real Chriſtianity: ſome have <hi>a Name to live, but are dead,</hi> Rev. 3.1. Have high Titles, but bad Hearts, vicious Lives; <hi>profeſs they know God, but in Works they deny him,</hi> Tit. 1.16. That have Heaven in their Mouths, and Hell in their Minds; that ſoar high, but deſign low: there may be a real Heathen under a Chriſtian Name: <hi>[Ad Eccleſiam non pertinent omnes qui ſunt intus:]</hi> All Church-Members, are not Members of Chriſt; they are not all <hi>Iſrael</hi> that are of <hi>Iſrael, Rom.</hi> 9.6. A fine Title may be on ſome Boxes, that have nothing within to Anſwer it: <hi>Judah</hi> that was uncircumciſed in heart, may be ranked with <hi>Aegypt, Edom, Moab, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> ſome may cry out, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.26. The Church, the Church, they are right Church-Members, that yet do wickedly, and think their Privileges will excuſe them, as though thereby <hi>they were delivered to do all manner of abominations,</hi> Jer. 7.4.16. They ſhall know one day, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:37116:11"/>an empty Name without the Thing, is but a great crime, that it will rather aggravate their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, then tend to their Salvation. Alas! how many are providential, not principled Chriſtians, that have nothing more to plead for their Chriſtianity then that they were born in a Chriſtian Country, and in their Infancy were baptized, and ſince do as other Folks do, go to Church, and carry civilly, and paſs amongſt men for down-right honeſt men: But God judgeth not as man judgeth; when Perſons ſtand before the awful Tribunal of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, Names, and Titles, and Privileges, will ſignifie nothing; ſuch Varniſh will melt off before the Fire of God's wrath; nothing then will ſignifie, but the inner Garment of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and the upper Garment of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for our Juſtification, to cover all defects of the former: this is <hi>fine Linnen, clean and white,</hi> Rev. 19.8. <hi>This is the Righteouſneſs of Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet Privileges are not to be ſlighted, nor Ordinances to be deſpis'd: As you are not to reſt in Circumciſion or Baptiſm, as tho' this were enough, ſo you are not to caſt off God's Inſtitutions, as if they were of no worth, there's a medium betwixt an abuſe, and total neglect: Men may abuſe Meat and Drink, yet muſt not lay them aſide: Ordinances can do us no good without the concurrence of Divine Grace; <hi>man lives not by Bread only, but by God's bleſſing therewith,</hi> Deut. 8.3. Muſt Bread be caſt out upon this Pretence? Surely no, it becomes us to obey God in Hearing, Praying, Reading,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:37116:12"/>Meditating and Attending on God in his own ways; the Seals of the Covenant are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Ceremonies: Ordinances are [<hi>cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les gratiae</hi>] Channels and Conduit-Pipes, through which God conveys his Grace to Souls: Theſe are <hi>Golden Pipes through which the Olive Branches empty the golden Oyl out of themſelves,</hi> Zech. 4.13. Souls, ſhall the Bucket be thrown away becauſe it hath not Water in it ſelf, without letting it down into the Well, by the Chain of Faith? Shall the Bridge or Boat be ſlighted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of it ſelf it cannot carry us over the River? Nay, rather let us get upon it and walk, get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it and Row, and wait for the Gale of the Spirit to waft us over: Privileges are good, the Fruits of Chriſt's purchace, the Pledges of God's Love, they muſt be made uſe of, tho' not truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to or boaſted of: you muſt be very thankful for, fruitful under pure and powerful Ordinances; let God have the glory, look you after the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of Privileges; ſet them in their places, not in God's room; let none ſay, <hi>thè Table of the Lord is contemptible,</hi> Mal. 1.7. Nor on the other hand, let not preſuming Souls ſay, <hi>Let us fetch the Ark of the Covenant, that it may ſave us,</hi> 1 Sam. 4.3. Alas, what can the Ark of God avail us, if the God of the Ark leave us? Let our dependance be on God in the way of his appointments: Affect not to be above, but go beyond all Ordinances, God is preſent in all, that we may deſpiſe none; he withdraws in ſome, (ſometimes in all) that we may idolize none: when you enter upon a Duty, look up to the bleſſed Jeſus, make Conſcience of, yea,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37116:12"/>make it your buſineſs to get communion with God therein: If you miſs of God in Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, you loſe your end; yea, you loſe your Souls: If you find God, glory in the Lord boaſt not of the Duty or Ordinances; ſit not down in the Porch, but make forward to the Holy of Holies; preſs to the City of Refuge, lay your Sacrifices at the Door of the Tabernacle, put your Offering into the High-Prieſt's hand; thank God for inlargements, but depend not on them; If you make your Services your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, you will periſh with them; when you have done all, ſay, <hi>I am ſtill an unprofitable Servant,</hi> Luke 17.10. I have but done my Duty; nay, I have not done my Duty, my beſt Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are not only too ſcant a Covering, but alſo <hi>filthy Rags, Iſa.</hi> 64.6. My very Duties as well as Sins may undoe me: yea, I find Hell-Torment the upſhot of Privileges; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advancement by Privileges, through a non-improvement of them ſinks deeper in Hell, as <hi>Corazin, Capernaum, Mat.</hi> 11.21, 24 For Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges to graceleſs Souls, do take away the Cloak that might cover the foulneſs of Sin; and ſo do rather aggravate than extenuate it, <hi>John</hi> 15.22, 24. I muſt therefore look for ſomething elſe than Privileges, that is, a New Creature.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THe main Point in the Text, and which I principally deſigned, is concerning the New Creature, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, New Creation [<hi>locutio eſt Chriſtiana</hi>] its a Speech peculiar and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37116:13"/>proper to the New-Teſtament diſpenſation: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature:</hi> i. e. If a man be a true Chriſtian, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the Goſpel Pattern, and Rule, and Ends, he is, and muſt be, and cannot but be of a new Frame and Stamp: So it was propheſyed of Old concerning Goſpel Times and Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; <hi>Behold the former things are come to paſs, and new things do I declare,</hi> Iſa. 42.9. ch. 65.17. <hi>Behold, I create new heavens, and new earth; yea, all things new:</hi> So here he frames a Work of Saving Grace in the Hearts of all his Saints: It ſignifies a new, noble, heavenly Diſpoſition, oppoſed to the antiquated corrupt ſtate of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, derived from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> called the Old Man.</p>
               <p>Que. <hi>Why is this called a Creature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe it is produced only by the Almighty Power of God, whoſe peculiar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative it is to Create.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe as a Creature, it hath a real Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence as this viſible frame of the Univerſe hath: If there be a Heaven and Earth, there is a new Creation in the Soul of Man; its no Fiction, Chimaera, or Imagination of man's brain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Creation makes a mighty change ſo doth this Work of Converſion, [<hi>vehementem mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem ſignificat</hi>] as Creation changeth a thing from a non-exiſtence to a real Being; ſo by this Work of Grace, <hi>Old things are paſt away, and all things become new:</hi> But of this more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p>Qu. 2. <hi>What's meant by New?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. <hi>New,</hi> in Scripture-language, ſignifies
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37116:13"/>1. Another, diſtinct and different from what was before: So <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.8. <hi>There aroſe a new King over Aegypt:</hi> i. e. another: Thus this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is diſtinct from the former, as <hi>Caleb</hi> is ſaid <hi>to have another Spirit,</hi> Numb. 14.24 (i.e) different and of another Nature, than the reſt of the Spyes; yea, what he himſelf formerly had: Thus it is with the Convert.</p>
               <p n="2">2. New ſignifies Strange, not heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.30. <hi>If the Lord make a new thing,</hi> if the Earth open her Mouth: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Wonder, a Prodigy never known before: So ſay they, <hi>What new Doctrine is this? thou bringeſt ſtrange things to our Ears,</hi> Acts 17.19, 20. Thus the Work of Regeneration was ſtrange, even to a great Doctor among the <hi>Jews, Job.</hi> 3.34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>New</hi> ſignifies ſomething ſecret, hidden, not eaſily diſcerned, or not manifeſt to all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.6. <hi>I have ſhewed thee new things, from this time, even hidden things:</hi> And this work of the New Creature, is much hid from the Eyes of others, and ſometimes kept ſecret from a man's own obſervation, <hi>Job</hi> 11.6. <hi>That he would ſhew thee, the ſecrets of Wiſdom:</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the hidden part thou ſhalt make me to know Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 51.6.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>New,</hi> imports ſomething excellent, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent, admirable, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.3. <hi>Sing unto him a new Song.</hi> Pſal. 42.10. <hi>Sing unto the Lord a new Song:</hi> i. e. an excellent Song, of the very beſt you can attain to: Even ſo this is the chief of God's Works in the world, and renders <hi>the Righteous more excellent then his Neighbour: and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37116:14"/>a man of underſtanding is of an excellent Spirit,</hi> Prov. 12.26. ch. 17.27.</p>
               <p>The Text being thus opened, I ſhall deduce an Obſervation relating to the preceeding Words of the Text; <hi>Circumciſion avails nothing, nor Uncircumciſion,</hi> in this New Teſtament-Diſpenſation by Chriſt. What is it it then that avails? The Anſwer is, The New Creature; this indeed is available: So this is ſet in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to the forementioned Privileges comprehended under this word <hi>Circumciſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Doctrine 2. <hi>That a New Creature is only and every way available to the Souls of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing elſe can avail any thing to mens E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation, but a New Creature; and this is very available.</p>
               <p>Underſtand this of things of this kind or nature: for a New Creature muſt not be ſet in competition with the Eternal Love of God, or Blood of Chriſt, or ſanctifying Operations of the Holy Spirit, for application of Chriſt's purchaces to us. A New Creature is but a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and cannot do the Work of the Infinite God, who hath appropriated Salvation-Work to himſelf; <hi>There is no Saviour beſides me, where is any other that may ſave them?</hi> Hoſ. 13.4.10. It is not any thing done by Man, nor wrought in man, that can ſave him from divine Wrath, or advance him to Heaven; No, the Lord ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies, ſanctifies, glorifies by Chriſt: All the Cauſes of man's Salvation, are without him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4, 9. 1ſt. There's the Efficient Cauſe, God's chuſing us. 2dly. The Material Cauſe, Chriſt's redeeming us. 3dly. The Formal, the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:37116:14"/>good pleaſure of his Will. 4thly. The Final, the praiſe of God's glorious Grace. So then we do not put this New Creature in God's room, as any cauſe at all of our Happineſs, but a neceſſary. Qualification, Diſpoſition, to which Salvation is annexed, or as the Apoſtle phraſeth it, that which accompanieth Salvation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Things that accompany Salvation</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] that have Salvation: <hi>i. e.</hi> commprehend it, are contiguous to it, touch it, have Happineſs annexed to it by the indiſpenſible connexion of Grace and Glory by Covenant-Promiſe.</p>
               <p>But more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this Doctrine, I ſhall ſpeak to theſe 4 Things in the Doctrinal part of it: <hi>Viz.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>What is this New Creature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer;</hi> In opening this, I ſhall explain Theſe 2 things
<list>
                     <item>
                        <label>1.</label> The Names given to it.</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Names or Titles given to this New Creature, which are ſynonymous Expreſſions, holding forth the ſame thing for Subſtance, are ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p>1ſt. Its called the forming of Chriſt in the womb of a Man's Heart; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.9. <hi>My little Children of whom I travail in birth again, until Chriſt be formed in you.</hi> Full glad would I be to ſee this bleſſed Embryo teamed in your Hearts.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:37116:15"/>
               <p>2dly. Its called quickening, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were dead-in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Alas! what dull Stocks and Lumps of Sin are we, till animated with the ſpirit of Grace, and quickned by a vital principle? And this is done with Chriſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. by his Reſurrection.</p>
               <p>3dly. Its called Parturition, or bringing forth by ſpiritual pangs of Soul-travail, New Birth; <hi>John</hi> 3.3. <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</hi> Convicting Grace brings a lively and lovely Offspring into the World, better than the product of Nature.</p>
               <p>4thly. Such Converts are compared to little Children, <hi>Mal.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you be converted, and become as little Children, you ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> i. e. You muſt needs have the Qualities and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions both of Infants and bigger Children.</p>
               <p>5thly. This work of God on the Soul, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a dying with Chriſt, and a riſing again with him; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>For if we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the likeneſs of his Death, we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſs of his Reſurrection,</hi> Col. 3.1. All real Chriſtians are riſen with Chriſt, hence it is called the <hi>firſt Reſurrection, Rev.</hi> 20.6. As if they were newly brought out of their Graves, that had been long dead, and uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>6thly, Its called the Image of God on Souls, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the New Man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>The new man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37116:15"/>This new Creature is a bleſſed Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of the Trinity of Perſons, in the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Mind, Will and Affections, conform to God.</p>
               <p>7thly. It is called the Divine Nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promiſes, that by theſe you might be partakers of the Divine Nature:</hi> i.e. Of thoſe Divine Qualities, whereby the Soul reſembles God, not only as a Picture doth a Man in outward Lineaments, but as a Child doth his Father, both in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and condition: As the noble Qualities of an Immortal Soul ſhew there is a God; ſo the renewed Faculties ſhew what that one God is: But more of this hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thus for the Names of this New Creature, moſt of which are figurative Expreſſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noting this ſame thing we are now treating of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Nature of this New Creature, take this Deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>The New Creature is a ſupernaturl Work of Goſpel-Grace wrought in the Soul of a Sinner, by the Word and Spirit of God, changing the whole Man from an old ſtate and courſe into a new, thereby transforming it into the Divine Likeneſs, and turning the Heart and Life to the rule of the Word, in order to the glory of God, and the Souls preſent and everlaſting commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: This is the New Creature.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this Deſcription is long, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leave out any of the parts thereof.</p>
               <p>I ſhall very briefly open the Branches of this deſcription.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the general Nature of it, I call it a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:37116:16"/>Supernatural Work, for it is above the power of nature to produce it, it comes from above; ſo he that's <hi>born again,</hi> John 3.3. Is [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>from above:</hi> This perfect Gift <hi>comes down from the Father of Lights,</hi> James 1.17. That <hi>Jeruſalem that's above, is the Mother of us all,</hi> Gal. 4.26. This New Creature is no Herb that grows in Nature's Garden; its a Plant of Paradiſe: <hi>Fleſh and Blood cannot ſo much as reveal this to the ſons of men,</hi> Matth. 16.17. Therefore its no wonder if learned Doctors (ſuch as <hi>Nicodemus</hi>) laugh at ſuch Doctrine, as Fantaſtical Fancies, and ſay, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> John 3.4. Or like <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s hearers, who ſaith, <hi>Ah Lord God, they ſay of me, Doth he not ſpeak Parables?</hi> Ezek. 20.49. For <hi>ſuch wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is too high for a Fool.</hi> Pſal. 56.9. In <hi>God's light only muſt we ſee light.</hi> Experience is the beſt Miſtriſs in theſe Caſes. <hi>We ſpeak wiſdom,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>among them that are perfect: But the natural man receives not the things of the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2 6, 14. This New Crerture is of a Coeleſtial Original, and muſt have an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Interpreter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this Deſcription, we have the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Nature of this New Creature; I call it a Goſpel-Grace: it is no branch or fruit of the Old Covenant of Works, for the Law maketh nothing perfect: <hi>There was no Law which could give Life,</hi> Gal. 3.2, 21, 28. But the New-Teſtament Diſpenſation, called the Promiſe; this only produceth the New Creation.</p>
               <p>Objection. You'l ſay, <hi>Had not Old-Teſtament
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37116:16"/>Saints this New Creature? Doth not</hi> David <hi>ſay,</hi> Create in me a clean heart? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10.</p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer;</hi> Old-Teſtament-Saints had a New-Teſtament-Spirit; for <hi>they without us could not be made perfect,</hi> Heb. 11.40. The ſame Goſpel belonged to them and us, and was preached to both, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>Abraham ſaw Chriſt's Day,</hi> they all partaked of Goſpel Grace, <hi>John</hi> 8.56. both in Juſtification and Sanctification; they were but different Editions of the ſame Goſpel-Covenant: they were as Children in Minority under <hi>Tutors and Governours,</hi> Gal. 4.1, 2, 25. Goſpel-Saints as Children at Age; their ſtate was under the Bond woman, in Mount <hi>Sinai; Ours is of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>which is free.</hi> However, that Goſpel-Promiſe, made known in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, belongs both to them and us; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you:</hi> This is the proper Goſpel-Work in both Diſpenſations: and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers of Old had experience of it, tho' the Veil was upon the Face of <hi>Moſes,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14, 15. and the Hearts of Carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> as it is on all Unbelievers to this day: but Goſpel-Grace renews Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here's the ſubject, in which this New Creature is, and that is in the Soul or Heart of a ſinner: There's the Seat and Centre of this New Creation; its not meerly external in the Eye, or Foot, or Hand, or Tongue; but its an internal work in the Soul, the Chriſtian <hi>is renewed in the Spirit of his Mind,</hi> Epheſ. 4.23. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith David, <hi>thou deſireſt Truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts; in the hidden part thou ſhalt make me
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:37116:17"/>to know Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. Its called <hi>the hidden man of the heart,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. Not but that it breaks out in Lip and Life: but the Root and Spring lies under Ground, out of the view of the world, as the beſt Treaſures are lock'd up, the beſt Goods are under Deck, or as Merchants Wares lie in a back Shop, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open view of the World: <hi>A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. Hence they are called <hi>God's hidden Ones,</hi> Pſal. 83.3. And <hi>the King's Daughter is all glorious within,</hi> Pſal. 45.13. Theſe gracious Souls are like Kings in diſguiſe; and it <hi>doth not yet appear what they ſhall be,</hi> 1 John 3.2. But when the Shell is broken, the Pearl will appear: all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Changes in men are but the change of the Clothes; this the change of the Man and his Manners: For <hi>he is not a Jew that is one outwardly, but inwardly:</hi> Right <hi>Circumciſion is that of the Heart, in the Spirit, not in the Letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men, but of God,</hi> Rom. 2.20, 30. It is wrought by God, and known to God, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſearcheth and ſees the Heart.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Inſtrumental, or Organical Cauſe of this New Man, which is <hi>the Word of God</hi> Rom. 1.16. This is <hi>the power of God to Salvation,</hi> James 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>Being born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth for ever.</hi> The Word is the Seed, which being ingrafted in the Heart, ſpringeth up in obedience, which is the Flower and viſible product of the New Creature; yea, 'tis properly the Goſpel-Word: <hi>Moſes</hi> or the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37116:17"/>Law may bring us to the Borders, but <hi>Joſhua</hi> leads us into <hi>Canaan;</hi> the terrors of the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the way, as <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but the Word of the Goſpel is the <hi>door of Faith,</hi> that takes Souls by the hand, and leads them into the Chamber of Preſence: this is God's method, to work this New Man by a powerful Goſpel-Sermon; ſo ſaith bleſſed <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.15. <hi>I have begotten you in Jeſus Chriſt through the goſpel;</hi> there's the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, <hi>Paul,</hi> I have begotten you; the <hi>means,</hi> by the <hi>goſpel;</hi> the author, in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10.14. Prov. 8.34. Therefore let all lie at the Gates of Wiſdom: Expect not this New Creation, if you turn your backs on God's Inſtitutions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Efficient Cauſe is the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>The love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us,</hi> Rom. 5.5. Oh what a gracious Tincture doth the Spirit leave upon Hearts! what a ſweet Breath doth it breath into them, which breaths out Love to God and Men! How is this New Creature diffuſed into all the Faculties of the Soul by the Spirit! This is both a Seal and an Earneſt, <hi>who hath alſo ſealed us,</hi> Eph. 6.13, 14. <hi>and given us the earneſt of the Spirit in our Hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.22. All good is conveyed to us by the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, eſpecially this Saving Good of Converſion; we are <hi>born again of Water and of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.3, 8. and ſanctified by the Spirit, born of the Spirit, and <hi>are Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11, 19. Nothing can ſearch or reach the Heart but the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>The Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:37116:18"/>of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.10. <hi>and deep things of Men.</hi> An An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is too ſhort-ſighted to ſee into Man's Heart, too ſhort-handed to reach the Conſcience, or make a New Creation: God alone turns Stones into Fleſh; <hi>God ſhall enlarge</hi> Japheth, <hi>and he ſhall dwell in the Tents of</hi> Shem, Gen. 9.27. It is an Act of Power to make a People willing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. or Volunteers: <hi>No man can come to Chriſt, except the Father which ſent him, draw him,</hi> Job 6.44. And God reacheth forth the Hand of the Spirit to attract Hearts to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The proper immediate Effect of this Work, that is, a change into a new Frame or Courſe, by which the Sinner becomes new, or another than what he was before; this is the [<hi>formalis Ratio</hi>] genuine neceſſary Attendant; yea, intrinſick nature of this which we call the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature, old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new.</hi> The Faculties are the ſame, but new Qualities are put in; as in a Lute, the Strings are the ſame, but 'tis ſet to a new Tune. In a River, the Water is the ſame, but 'tis put into a new Channel, the Bowl hath got a new Byaſs: So the Convert ſaid to the tempting Harlot [<hi>Ego non ſum Ego</hi>] I am not I; or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of himſelf, <hi>who was before a Blaſphemer, a Perſecutor: but I obtained mercy,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. <hi>i. e.</hi> converting Grace hath changed me. Thus the ſame Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Corinthians, Such were ſome of you, but ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> are waſhed, but ye are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. Oh what a mighty change doth Grace make! from Lying to Fearing an Oath; from vain ſpeaking,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37116:18"/>to Holy Diſcourſe; from careleſneſs, to the greateſt concernedneſs about Soul affairs; yea, <hi>from Darkneſs to Light,</hi> Eph. 5.8. <hi>From Death to Life; from Satan to God,</hi> Acts 26.18. The Man is now got into a new World, as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. <hi>I will give them one Heart;</hi> which that I may do, I will caſt it a new, in order to this, I will melt and ſoften it, as one that hath many pieces of old Silver by them, caſts them into the Fire, melts them, and molds them into one Bowle: Thus doth God with the divided Heart in renewing it, and framing it for his uſe.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Here's yet further the compleatneſs of this Change; its not ſome external Acts, Motions, Converſation, nor only Internal Cogitations, Affections, Workings of the Will and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; but the deſcription goes further, even to the State, Conſtitution, Relation of the Man; and therefore I add, [changing the whole man from an old ſtate to a new] for every Man and Woman hath a ſtate before God; therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſends <hi>Timothy, to know the ſtate of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians,</hi> Phil. 2.19. This imports not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Act, but a ſettled abiding Frame, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Relation: Sinners <hi>are by Nature Children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. Limbs of Satan, Heirs of Hell; this new Mold makes them Children of God, Members of Chriſt, Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yea, it puts them into an habitual ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency towards Heaven, and heavenly things, which is a kind of a ſecond Nature in them; this moves the holy Soul (acting like it ſelf) as naturally upwards, as a Stone moves downward,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37116:19"/>therefore its called a <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 14. the acting follows the being of a thing: <hi>Make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good,</hi> Mat. 12.33. If a Watch be not well made, it will never go well: They ſay of the Peacock, roaſt him as much as you will, yet when cold, his Fleſh will be raw again. So force a Carnal Heart to the higheſt ſtrain of ſeeming Piety, yet it will come to its old Complexion, becauſe there's not a new Nature: fill a Pond full of Water, it will abate if there be not a Spring to ſupply it: The New Creature is united to Chriſt, and <hi>receives grace for grace,</hi> John 1.61.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Here's the Pattern, Copy, Example, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which this New Creature is moulded, [it is the Soul's being transformed into the divine likeneſs] this Image of God conſiſts in Knowledge in the Intellectual Faculties, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the Will, Holineſs in the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. <hi>And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>That you put on the new man, which after God is created in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and true Holineſs; or holineſs of truth.</hi> As the Work of Grace in the Heart is a true Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or Tranſcript of the Divine Image, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as the Face in the Glaſs doth, with the Face of the Man that looks in it, or as the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage in the Wax with the Sculpture in the Seal, from which it is derived: Godlineſs is Godlikeneſs [<hi>Summa Religionis eſt imitari quem Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>] The Summ and Subſtance of our Religion is to imitate whom we worſhip: not that its poſſible to be like God with a perfection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37116:19"/>but Sincerity; <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> Mat. 5.48. A Child hath the parts of a Man, though not the bulk; for the New Creature is in a daily increaſe, and tendeth to perfection, as a ſmall Seed hath ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the bigneſs of a grown Tree, though little in its ſelf: But the Chriſtian is like God; man only can beget a man like himſelf: So the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only doth beget the Chriſtian like God.

There's the Rule of this New Creature, which is expreſſed, by [turning the Heart and Life to the Rule of the Word]; this either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the manner of framing the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the Rule by which the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acts and moves, being once formed: As to the former, the New Creature receives the Stamp, Signature, and Impreſſion of the Word: <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17. <hi>But God be thanked, that ye were the ſervants of ſin: But ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered unto you:</hi> Or as it is more properly in the Greek [<gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Every Child of God is taught by God to walk by Rule: All Callings have their proper Rule; the Phyſician ſtudies <hi>Galen;</hi> the Lawyer his <hi>Littleton;</hi> the Philoſopher his <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato:</hi> yet in all Profeſſions men may vary in their Methods, in the ſame Calling, becauſe no Rule is ſo perfect, but another may add to it: But the ſtanding Rule of God's Word, is <hi>perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. <hi>able to make the man of God perfect,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. Nothing muſt be added to it, or taken from it. The Chriſtian is both drawn and determined by its authority more then by a whole team of humane Arguments.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> here's the End of this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37116:20"/>which is twofold, [1. the Glory of God: 2. the Sonl's preſent and everlaſting Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him:] Both theſe are wrap'd up together, and are very conſiſtent; yea, cannot be ſeparated. Now God's Glory is promoted by the New Creature; 1. In this World; 2. In the other.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this World the New Creature is only capable of glorifying God; ſuch a Soul is planted in Chriſt the true Vine, and <hi>glorifies God by bringing forth much Fruit,</hi> John 15.8. <hi>Being filled with the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the glory and praiſe of God,</hi> Phil 1.11. The chief deſign of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian and new Creature, is to promote the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, actively and paſſively; this is the firſt Petition in the Lord's Prayer; and the firſt right Step the converted Soul takes Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-ward; and he is content to be vilified, ſo God may be glorified; and if God be glorified by others, what ever become of him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth, as <hi>Paul,</hi> in preaching Chriſt by others, to preach down his credit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And in the next World, this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will raiſe a glorious Monument, to the glory of <hi>Jehovah, When he ſhall come to be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his Saints, and admired in all them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.10. The New Glory of this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will reflect more glory to the Author, than that of the old one: Oh what a glorious Sight will it be to ſee ſo many glorious Stars in the Firmament of Glory, borrowing their Light from and reflecting Light to the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:37116:21"/>
               <p n="2">2. The New Creature is the only Perſon on Earth that's qualified for Communion with God; he only can ſay, <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 John 1.3. 'Tis this New Creation that raiſeth this clod of Clay above the Earth, and ingageth the Heart to approach to God, while others <hi>worſhip afar off,</hi> Jer. 30.21. Exod. 24. Theſe Holy Souls are they that worſhip in the <hi>Temple of God, and the Altar,</hi> Rev. 11.1. Pſal. 148.14. God admits them into his Preſence, as a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple near unto him: this is the Perſon that only ſanctifies God's Name in his Worſhip, and is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the fatneſs of God's Houſe: here's the bleſſed Merchant that trades in rich Pearls, that goes from Port to Port, from Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to Ordinance; not to ſee Places, but to take in his Lading of Communications from God, of Graces, Privileges, Aſſurance and Comforts.</p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly opened the nature of this bleſſed Work of the New Creature.</p>

               <head>Chap. III. <hi>Why this is called a New Creature? A Paralel betwixt the Old Creation and this New Creation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p n="2">2. THe Second general Head in the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Part, is briefly to give the Reaſons why the Holy Ghoſt gives this Saving Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Title of a <hi>New Creature,</hi> or (as the Word is) of this <hi>New Creation.</hi> Now the Anſwer is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in many things it bears ſome proportion and reſemblance with the firſt ſpacious Univerſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37116:21"/>of Heaven and Earth, this magnificent Structure. I ſhall run the Paralel betwixt them in theſe 12 Particulars, for the Information of our Judgments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God is the firſt and only Cauſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, not Angels or created Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, who though they be mighty, yet are not Almighty; its the peculiar prerogative of <hi>Elohim,</hi> the infinite God, to create: God orders the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> to repeat that famous Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Language, to confute their Idolatry, in <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Thus ſhall ye ſay unto them, the Gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens.</hi> The Reaſon is given in the Hebrew Language, <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. <hi>He hath made the Earth by his Power; he hath eſtabliſhed the World by his Wiſdom, and hath ſtretched out the Heavens by his diſcretion.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid</hi>Weem<hi>'s Image of God in Man,</hi> p.3.</note> In the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Creation, Divines ſay, [<hi>Deus eſt cauſa Simpliciter in Creatione, at Eſſendi hoc in aliis</hi>] God is the only Simple Cauſe in Creation, but in his other Works, he is only the Cauſe of being this or that: So none can create this New Man, it may be ſaid, <hi>Have we not all one Father? hath not one great God created us? We are God's workmanſhip, its the ſame mighty power that raiſed Christ from the Dead that gives Faith</hi> to the Souls of Men, and quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens the Dead, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God made all things of Nothing, <hi>i.e.</hi> of things that had no Exiſtence before he made them; <hi>He calleth thoſe things which be not, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37116:22"/>though they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17. Indeed they tell us that [Nothing] is taken in a threefold Sence; 1st. Its taken privatively, ſo an Idol is nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.17. <hi>i.e.</hi> it hath no Divinity in it; 2dly. Comparatively, ſo all the World is nothing before God; 3dly. Nothing Negative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or Simply; ſo there was no Fruit upon the Fig-tree, <hi>Mark</hi> 11.13. In this Sence God made the World of Nothing; there was no Praeexiſtent Matter for God to work upon: Juſt thus in the New Creation, when God comes to work upon a Sinner, he finds no Principle of Grace, or inclination to good in him: <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith bleſſed <hi>Paul, that in me, that is in my Fleſh, dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7.18. Nay, there is much Evil in us, yea, yet worſe, there's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to what is good, within our naughty Hearts: Thus as in the Firſt Creation, God produceth an habit from the negation: he works a Principle of Grace where there was no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God made all things by Chriſt, his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and co-eternal Son: <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> (i. e. by this Eſſential Word) <hi>and without him was not any thing made that was made,</hi> John 1.3. <hi>By him were all things created, viſible and inviſible.</hi> By this Heir of all things he made the Worlds, both according to the Matter and Form thereof, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. And thus it is in the New Creation, for <hi>we are his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. As Chriſt is the Firſt-born of the Creatures, after whom the New Creature is formed; for God in his naked Majeſty is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37116:22"/>not obvious clearly either to corporal Eyes or humane Minds, but Chriſt is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of his Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the glorious Perfections of the infinite God: That <hi>as we have born the Image of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Adam, <hi>we ſhould bear the Image of the heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.45, 49. That is Chriſt; thus in the Incarnation, God was Man; in Regeneration, Man becomes like God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God created all things with a Word: So ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Through Faith we underſtand, that the Worlds were framed by the VVord of God,</hi> Heb. 11.3. God's [<hi>Fiat</hi> or] Let it be, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the whole Fabrick of Heaven and Earth: <hi>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Hoſt of them, by the Breath of his Mouth,</hi> Pſal. 33.6. Art needeth many Helps; Nature needeth few; God needeth none; nor doth uſe any Inſtrument in the Creation, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can intervene betwixt the Firſt Cauſe and the Firſt Effect; it is an immediate Product of his arbitrary Will and Pleaſure. So it is in this New Creation, <hi>James</hi> 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat he us with the Word of Truth.</hi> God ſpeaks the Word, and the Sinner is converted. If it be ſaid, That Miniſters are Inſtruments in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But ſtill they are nothing, <hi>neither is he that planteth any thing,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.7. They need God; God needs not them, he can do his Work without them; yea, in the firſt Infuſion of a Principle of Saving Grace, there's nothing of Inſtrumentality; its done Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:37116:23"/>
               <p n="5">5. God made all things good and perfect at firſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31. Every Creature of God is good: And God ſaw every thing that he had made, and behold it was very good, <hi>quia nec temere nec fruſtra factum</hi>] nothing was made either unadviſedly or to no purpoſe. A thing may be ſaid to be good, as it is correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Idea of the Divine Wiſdom, or as it is fit for that uſe to which it is deſigned, and for which it ſerves: It needs not be enquired, whether God could not have made the World, or its parts, better or more perfect; for if we conſider the World in reſpect of the whole; ſo it is perfect both as to its degrees and parts: But as to its parts ſeverally, God could have made them better; as in a Camp, there are Captains, Souldiers, and a General; in ſome reſpect if a Souldier were a Captain, he were better, but in reſpect of the whole Camp, (which conſiſts of Superiors and Inferiors) he is better as a Souldier. So in this New Creature, it is perfect in its kind, in ſubſerviency to God's great Ends, though defective in point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in this World: hence God's Children are ſaid to be not perfect, as <hi>having not attained,</hi> Phil. 3.12. <hi>Yet they are perfect,</hi> Ver. 15. To be ſure this New Creation is good, as will appear anon.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Though God from Eternity purpoſed to create the World, yet the World was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but in Time, not from Eternity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth. God worketh all things according to the Counſel of his own Will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. Its true, all things had a kind of Being in God, as in the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:37116:23"/>Cauſe, whence all things flow, in the Eternal Mind, or Idea, according to which all things were framed; but they had not their real or actual Exiſtence, till God in his Wiſdom thought good to produce them: <hi>In thy Book,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 116.16. <hi>were all my Members written.</hi> Thus it is in this New Creation: God hath a Book of Life, and ſuch as are in the Book of Life, ſhall in time be ſavingly Converted, Called, Sanctified, Juſtified, Glorified. Thus runs the Golden Chain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.30. <hi>As many as were ordained to Eternal Life, ſhall believe:</hi> All ſuch as <hi>the Father gives to Chriſt, ſhall come to him,</hi> John 6.37. <hi>He hath choſen us in Chriſt before the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World, that we ſhould be holy,</hi> Eph. 1.4. So then this New Creation in time, is the reſult and effect of God's determination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Time: ſee 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Creation of the World was gradual, both as to Time, and as to Manner: In point of Time, God made the World in Six Days, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. Not but that God could have diſpatch'd all in a Moment, but for ſundry weighty Reaſons he took every day a moment to do the work of that day in: Thus God is perfecting this New Creation all the time of a Chriſtian's Life: and for his manner or method of working, God proceeded from imperfect to perfect; firſt God made a confuſed Chaos, then he made the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then [<hi>orta ex Elementis</hi>] what ariſeth from them: Firſt he made things without Life, then things having Life: Man, that was the Maſter-piece of the whole Creation, he made the laſt. Even thus doth Grace proceed in the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37116:24"/>New Creation; he firſt forms a Chaos, ſome confuſion of Spirit, by a legal Work, firſt <hi>comes a Spirit of Bondage,</hi> to fear, <hi>then a Spirit of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi> Rom. 8.15. Firſt ſome glimmering Light in the Mind, then the Day-Star ariſeth in the Soul, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. And the <hi>Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes with healing under his Wings,</hi> Mal. 4.2. And the Grace of God grows, till the Chriſtian comes unto a perfect Man, <hi>unto the meaſure of the Stature of the Fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The firſt thing that God created, was Light, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.4. <hi>God ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was Light:</hi> In this he proceeds from total Privation to Habit: it is hard to deſcribe this Light, poſſibly it was a bright lucid Body, like the Fiery Cloud in the Wilderneſs, giving imperfect Light, ſucceſſively moving over the ſeveral parts of the Earth, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed, increaſed, perfected, and gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Sun; the Apoſtle applies this to the workings of God's Spirit in converting a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The firſt thing a Limner draws in a Picture, is the Eye: the firſt Lineament of this gracious new Man, is Saving Knowledge: God will not dwell in a dark Houſe, and therefore firſt he beats out Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, in his Habitation, <hi>without knowledge the heart is not good,</hi> Prov. 19.2. The Devil's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is a Kingdom of Darkneſs; Chriſt's of Light: Converting Grace delivers us <hi>from the power of darkneſs, and tranſlates us into the Kingdom
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37116:24"/>of his dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. which is a State of <hi>marvelous Light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9.</p>
               <p n="9">9. God created ſome things Actually, other things Potentially, or Vertually, Gen. 1.11, 12. And <hi>God ſaid, Let the Earth bring forth Graſs, the Herb yielding Seed, the Tree yielding Fruit.</hi> Some things were made in their firſt Principles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Fruits in their proper kind, as from Bees, Honey; from Vine, Grapes, and thence Wine; Oyl from the Olive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus it is in the New Creation, God plants a Seed, an Habit of Spritual Life, which of its own Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines the Chriſtian to Acts of Holineſs: In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Habit there is a propenſity to act; ſo <hi>Faith worketh by Love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. Repentance brings forth <hi>Fruits meet for ſuch a Principle,</hi> Matth. 3.18. Heavenly Acts are the genuine Fruits of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, yea, inſeparable Companions.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The ſame Hand that created, doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Creature: alſo, it would crumble into its primitive nothing: So <hi>God upholds all things by the Word of his Power,</hi> Heb. 13. He doth not as an Artificer, who makes a Clock, a Watch, a Ship, or other Machin, and leaves it to others to wind it up, or maintain it; but a divine Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancy is vouchſafed to every Creature, which God hath made; Creatures are but Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to the Body; or as the Reflection of the Glaſs which vaniſheth, when the Face is turned away: Pſal. 104.29. <hi>Thou hideſt thy Face, they are troubled; thou takest away thy Breath, they die, and return to the Dust.</hi> In the Chain of Second Cauſes, God ſtands at the upper end, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates every thing thereof by his Influency: <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Every Creature hath a legible Character of God's Power, Wiſdom, Goodneſs ingraven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; and hath a Mouth to preach ſomething of the Magnificence of its Creator; yea, the viſible Creature leads man to its viſible maker;

               <p n="1">1. For the Kind, we muſt beware how we put the New Creature in the room of Chriſt: it is not ſo available as our bleſſed Lord Jeſus is, who is the only <hi>Foundation, on which the Church is built,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.10. And <hi>able to ſave to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,</hi> Heb. 7.25. No Creature muſt be ſet up in competition with him, for <hi>there's no Salvation in any other,</hi> Acts 4.12. And herein I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid the <hi>Quakers</hi> are guilty of a groſs Hereſie, who call us from a Chriſt without us, to a Chriſt within us: yea, it hath been a diſpute in the Plantation, called <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> whether we muſt believe only in a Chriſt within us, or a Chriſt both within and without us, and it was carried moſtly in the former Sence: But let no man be drawn from placing his intire confidence in Chriſt the Son of God, both God and Man in one Perſon, who ſuffered Death on the Croſs, to make attonement for Sinners, and now <hi>ſits on the right hand of God to make interceſſion for us.</hi> 2. If by a Chriſt within, they mean that called Light within, either Free will or Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or a power to help our ſelves without ſpecial Grace, its an exploded Error, and it's to be feared, the Jeſuits deliver their Popiſh ſtuff out of theſe mens Mouths with refined Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. 3. If by Chriſt within, be meant Chriſt's Perſon in the Believer, that he is Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Goded, 'tis blaſphemy. 4. If by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>Chriſt within us, the hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. or <hi>Christ dwelling in our hearts by faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37116:30"/>It is as the Sun is in the Houſe, when the Beams or Rays thereof ſhine into it: So Chriſt dwells in Souls by his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. and its Graces; and this is that which is called the <hi>New Creature,</hi> and this is but a Creature, and a weak one, full of imperfections; its a Vein of Gold embaſed with Earth and droſs, not to be truſted to: The Bride may highly prize her Husband's Picture, if like him, and drawn by his Hand; but it is ridiculous to dote on that, and ſlight her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and when ſhe wants Money or Clothes, to go not to her Husband for them, but to his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Surely, our Lord will not take it well, if men honour his Image, to the diſhonour of his Perſon: the Original is one thing, the Copy is another: Chriſt the object of our Faith and Grace, and the Fruit of his Spirit are different: Grace in the Heart is not ſo available as Chriſt in Heaven. Let every thing have its due place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which refers to the End, is this Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that the New Creature is not ordained to have a direct tendency to the juſtification of a Sinner; God did not appoint it for that End: That is Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20, 21, 22. in his Blood, Merits and Satisfaction to Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, apprehended by Faith alone: And this excludes not only Man's merits, but any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Habits wrought in man, or good Works done by man; nay, it alſo excludes Faith it ſelf as the work of man, any otherwiſe then as laying hold on Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. But this I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that this New Creature, or the beſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Righteouſneſs cannot juſtifie a Sinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's Tribunal: For a <hi>Man is not juſtified by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37116:31"/>the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 2.16. And leſt any ſhould ſay, it was by the Works only of the Ceremonial Law, its apparent the Apoſtle includes the Moral Law, that obſervance thereof cannot juſtifie; for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were never bound to the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law, yet he proves both <hi>Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to be both under ſin,</hi> Rom. 3.9.-2.28, 30. and both alike juſtified by Chriſt in the way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving: But <hi>where there is no Law, there is no Tranſgreſſion,</hi> Rom. 4.15. Beſides, that Law that ſhews Sin, is the moral Law; <hi>For by the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3.20. And 'tis that Law that drives us out of Self to Chriſt, and therefore it can never juſtifie us: God hath nailed up that Door, that none ſince the Fall, can enter into Happineſs by Law-Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; This way to Heaven, is like the Northern Paſſage to the <hi>Indies,</hi> whoever attempts it, is ſure to be frozen up before he gets half way thither.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if a legal Righteouſneſs by our own ſtrength will not juſtifie a Sinner, yet this New Creature, or the habit or exerciſe of Evangelical Righteouſneſs will ſurely juſtifie?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtle himſelf Anſwers, No; and he inſtanceth in two famous Saints in the Old-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, the one is <hi>Abraham,</hi> the other <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 4.1, 6 Faithful, Holy <hi>Abraham,</hi> though no Idolater, but circumciſed, offering his Son, muſt not glory in any Habit or Acts of Grace. And <hi>David,</hi> though a Man after God's own Heart, yet ſaith, <hi>Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living be juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:37116:31"/>Pſal. 143.2. <hi>If the Lord mark iniquity, who can ſtand?</hi> Pſal. 130.3. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> dare not ſtand in his own Righteouſneſs at God's Bar, but <hi>in the Righteouſneſs, which is of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3.7.8, 9. Indeed this imparted or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Holineſs, was infuſed into the Soul for other Ends than to juſtifie a Sinner before God from the guilt of any one Sin: and yet this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very available to the Souls of men in theſe 12 caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This New Creature rectifies the Soul's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, that were marred by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall: The former Structure, though once a famous Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; by the Fall was not only tottering, but a ruinous Houſe, and lies in Rubbiſh; this New Creation re-edifies it in a more ſtately ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manner: yea, it is richly adorned thereby, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.9. <hi>They ſhall be an Ornament of Grace un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Head, and Chains about thy Neck,</hi> Prov. 12.26. ch. 17.27. Thereby the Chriſtian <hi>is more excellent then his Neighbour,</hi> and of <hi>an excellent Spirit,</hi> more excellent then himſelf was; he is by this become like the Angels, yea, like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and though he be ſhort of <hi>Adam</hi> in the degree of Grace; yet upon better terms, in point of duration: and now <hi>great Grace</hi> is upon all true Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.33. Man by his Fall <hi>became like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſal. 49.12. But this New Creature makes him better then other men. All men are level as to God, till this New Creation ſets a divine Stamp on ſome: <hi>The tongue of the Juſt is as choice Silver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth,</hi> Prov. 10.20. God only
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:37116:32"/>hath Soveraignty and Authority, to rate his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: this is the Eſtimate he ſets on his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This New Creature is the fruit and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Electing-Love; this is the legible print of God's Heart from Eternity: <hi>He hath choſen us,</hi> Eph. 1.4. <hi>that we ſhould be holy:</hi> This is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per product of free undeſerved Grace, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.15. God <hi>calls by his Grace;</hi> This is the glorious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his Banner of Love over Souls. In the Old Creation there was the ſtrength of God's Arm; in this there is the working of God's Bowels: God found all mankind alike involved in Sin and Miſery, but <hi>Grace makes ſome to differ from others,</hi> 1 Cor. 46.7. As a curious workman ſeeing a Forreſt overgrowing his Ground, marks ſome Trees, deſigning to make of them ſome rare pieces of workmanſhip; thus God carves his own Image on a common Log, and ſets it apart for himſelf; this is an act of diſcriminating Love, and when the Sinner ſees it, he muſt cry out, <hi>Who am I, O Lord God, that thou haſt brought me hitherto?</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18. <hi>By the Grace of God I am what I am,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.10. This, this is a <hi>ſhedding abroad his love in my Heart,</hi> Rom. 5.5. I read Love in every Line and Letter of this new Impreſſion: and doth not this avail a Soul much?</p>
               <p n="3">3. This New Creation conſecrates the Soul to be a receptacle for God, and renders the Perſon acceptable to him: God dwells in the humble and holy Heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. There only he takes up his lodging, when he hath perfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Heart with Mirrh and Frankincenſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.6. He lays himſelf in that ſweet Bed:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37116:32"/>Having builded this Manſion-Houſe, it <hi>becomes an habitation of God through the Spirit: a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Epheſ. 2.22.1 Cor. 6.17, 19. God hath two Thrones in Heaven, and in an Holy Heart: The Soul and Body is a <hi>Sacrifice holy and acceptable to God,</hi> Rom. 12.1. Happy Soul, that is thus owned by the Great God: no matter if men reject you, if God accept you: if men deſert you, yet if God poſſeſs you, you are are happy: when God caſts out the Devil's bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and ſaith, <hi>This is my Reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it,</hi> Pſal. 132.14, 15. No bad Houſe will be kept there where God dwells, for he makes all welcome; this is available.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The firſt inſtant of this New Creation, commenceth a Communion with God; this is a conſequence of the former, and the peculiar privilege of a Saint, <hi>Truly, our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son,</hi> 1 John 1.3. This communion with God, is a myſtery to moſt men. Every one that hangs about the Court, doth not ſpeak with the King: many meddle with Duties, but meet not with God: <hi>It is good for me to draw night to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28. How oft doth the Chriſtian cry out, <hi>Oh when ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> Pſal. 63.2. This New Creature puts a Biaſs in the Soul God-wards, it naturally mounts the Soul upwards, to ingage <hi>his heart in approaching to God,</hi> Jer. 30.21. And the <hi>Lord meets him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> Iſa. 64. Birds cannot converſe with Men, there's not a ſuitableneſs of Nature; an <hi>Hypocrite cannot, dare not come before God,</hi> Job 13.16. But a Saint dare draw near with boldneſs through
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37116:33"/>Chriſt; for he is like God, and [<hi>communio fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datur in Similitudine</hi>] Communion is founded in Similitude.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This New Creature evidenceth a Soul's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt, and his union to him; yea, puts the poor Believer in a capacity of ſucking Influence from him, as the Child in the Womb draws nouriſhment from the Mother's Navel; this Churches Navel never wanteth Liquor, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.2. It is this New Creature that evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth our intereſt in Chriſt: <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. This was one End of our Lord's giving himſelf for us, to <hi>purchaſe to himſelf a peculiar People,</hi> Tit. 2.14. Chriſt's Croſs was both an Altar and a Laver, to expiate, and to purge, to ſanctifie and juſtifie: you ſhall find continual ſupplies of Grace from Chriſt, and of his fulneſs receive <hi>grace for grace,</hi> John 1.16. The New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath a conſtant Spring to feed it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit it in its decays, God ſtill ſaith, <hi>My Grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. So he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes indefectible, the New Creature needs not to fear famiſhing, having theſe Breaſts of Conſolation to ſuck, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11. and as a Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe to go to; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. <hi>The God of all Grace, who hath called us into his eternal glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after that ye have ſuffered a while, make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you:</hi> Surely then this New Creature avails much.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The New Creature is the inlet to true Joy, Peace, Satisfaction; though in its firſt Infancy, there be a caſting down, yet it is in order to a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:37116:33"/>lifting up: Light is ſown for the Righteous, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. It may for a ſeaſon lie in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Goſpel-ſorrow: <hi>They that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy,</hi> Pſal. 126.5, 6. Juſt like the Pangs of a Child-bearing Woman, that end in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>John</hi> 16.21. The <hi>Kingdom of God is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, peace, and joy in the holy ghoſt:</hi> Rom. 14.17. all Joy comes in at this Door: that's but a Baſtard, yea, diabolical Peace, that is not a Companion of the New Creature; <hi>when a ſtrong man armed keepeth the Palace, his goods are in peace,</hi> Luke 11.21, 22. The Palace is the Heart, the Goods are the Soul's faculties; the Strong Man is the Devil: the Soul hath never quiet day in God's way, till Satan be diſpoſſeſſed, and a rightful Lord introduced, that is, our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Its true, there are oft Furrows in the Face of the new Creature, but they are for Sin, and for want of the Sence of its inbeing; but in God's time, <hi>he will rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8. Yea, ſorrowful Sufferings will at laſt <hi>yield the peaceable fruits of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Heb. 12.11. And is this worth nothing?</p>
               <p n="7">7. This New Creature hath all things profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table entailed upon it: <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things:</hi> yea, <hi>Godlineſs with contentment, is great gain,</hi> 1. Tim. 4.8-6.6. All the good things of Heaven and Earth, are made ſure by Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title to this New Creature: <hi>All things are yours,</hi> ſaith God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. Every thing turns to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: the Chriſtian is the true Chymiſt, to extract Gold out of every thing: <hi>All things work together for good to him,</hi> Rom. 8.28. though not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37116:34"/>ſingly, yet joyntly, in compoſition with other Ingredients; he gains to this New Man by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Loſſes: Every Mercy, Ordinance, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Affliction, is a Talent by which he is a gainer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.27. If he fight with Satan, he gets Ground at laſt. In petty Skirmiſhes the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> got ſome ſmall Victories, but the <hi>Romans</hi> came off Conquerors at laſt. So the Godly Soul may receive ſome Foils, but at <hi>laſt he ſhall be more than a Conqueror,</hi> yea, <hi>a triumpher</hi> through the Captain of his Salvation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.37.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The New Creature renders the Perſon that hath it, ſafe, in a ſafe condition. He <hi>that dwelleth in the ſecret place of the Moſt High, ſhall abide under the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſal. 91.1. The Holy Angels are a royal Guard to theſe <hi>New-born Babes of Salvation,</hi> Heb. 1.14. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are the dangers the New Creature is expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to, but one Angel is as a whole Camp, to incompaſs and deliver God-fearing Souls, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7-6.18. But the God of Angels is nigh to them, and ſaves them: in Spirituals God will ſecure them from Seduction, and the evil of Temptation. It is not poſſible that the Elect ſhall be finally and damnably ſeduced, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. for Grace eſtabliſheth the Heart; and they <hi>that are of us, ſhall no doubt continue with us,</hi> Heb. 13.9. They ſhall <hi>be kept by his mighty power, through Faith to Salvation,</hi> 1 John 2.19. 1 Pet. 1.5. And we know that theſe Souls that are born of God, are ſo kept, <hi>that the wicked One toucheth them not,</hi> 1 John 5.18. God will <hi>keep them, that they ſhall not be tempted above what they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37116:34"/>are able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. God will furniſh his Child with Armour of proof againſt Satan's aſſaults; this Breaſt-plate may be ſhot at, but never ſhot through; the <hi>Chriſtians Bow abides in ſtrength,</hi> and he ſtands as a Rock in the midſt of Waves, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. He can neither be ſtormed nor undermined, if the Saints have but a little ſtrength, yet it ſhall be laſting, yea, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The New Creature makes Chriſtians that poſſeſs it, uſeful and profitable to all about them: It is natural for this New Creature to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate its kind; as Sin, ſo Grace is aſſimilating: how ſollicitous was the Church for her <hi>little Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter that had no Breaſts, when ſhe ſhould be ſpoken for,</hi> Cant. 8.8. How did the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> pant after the Converſion of his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9.1.-10.1. The Godly Soul labours to do good to all about him, both good and bad: He would fain pluck Sinners out of the Fire of Hell, <hi>Jude</hi> 22. and ingage them for Heaven: and he ſpurs on his Brethren in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's-Road, by Counſels, Admonitions, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Example, and all holy Exerciſes in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion: yea, this New Creature where ever it is, makes ſuch the Pillars of the Place and Nation, where they live: Ten Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Perſons might have ſaved <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18.19, 22. And <hi>Lot's</hi> preſence there, bound the Angels Hands till he was gone: the Godly Soul ſhall never know while he lives, what uſe he was of in the world: Every Godly Soul is a fruitful Tree, that <hi>brings forth Fruit in due ſeaſon, yea, in old age,</hi> Pſal. 1.3.-92.14.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:37116:35"/>
               <p n="10">10. This New Creature fits Souls for Goſpel-Privileges; it is only the New Creature that is a Veſſel qualify'd to receive the new Wine of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.16, 17. In the Goſpel all things are new, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.5. There's a New Name, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. New Church, <hi>Jeruſalem, Rev.</hi> 21.1. New Way, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19. New Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. A New Commandment, <hi>John</hi> 13.32. New Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.26-28.19. New Relation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. A New Condition, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.13. And a New Song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3. Yea, New Heavens, and a New Earth. And ſurely it is very fit that Chriſtians ſhould have New Hearts, which God promiſeth in the New Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>A new heart will I give you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you.</hi> New Qualifications fit Perſons for new Diſpenſations; therefore God joyns the new Heavens, and <hi>new Earth with the new Seed,</hi> Iſa. 66.22. elſe there would be a great Inconſiſtency: New Palates will find ſweetneſs in this new Meat and new Wine, elſe it will be loſt upon them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The New Creature fits Perſons for Death and Heaven: To <hi>theſe to live is Chriſt, and to dye gain,</hi> Phil. 1.21. <hi>Living and Dying, theſe are the Lord's,</hi> Rom. 14. Its this that renders Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>meet for that heavenly Inheritance,</hi> Col. 1.12. No Eyes can ſee God, but of thoſe that are <hi>pure in Heart,</hi> Mat. 5.8. Theſe, and only theſe, are <hi>wrought for this ſelf-ſame thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.5. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is not like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, that had clean and unclean Creatures brought into it: <hi>Without Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12.14. Frogs came into <hi>Pharoah</hi>'s Court; but no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:37116:35"/>thing can enter Heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.9. A ſenſual Pallate cannot taſte the ſweetneſs of that Wine in our Father's Kingdom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. For its New Wine, and renewed Souls are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of taking pleaſure in it: O happy Soul, that hath got Chriſt in the Arms of his Faith, and in his Heart by this New Nature, he may lift up his Head, and ſay with <hi>Simeon, Now, Lord, letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in Peace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy Word, for mine Eyes have ſeen thy Salvation,</hi> Luk. 2.29, 30. And is not this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to Souls?</p>
               <p n="12">12. Yea this New Creature is Heaven begun: it is a conſiderable part of Heaven; Holineſs is a conſiderable Happineſs; its the Seed and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo of that heavenly ſtate: Grace and Glory as they are joyned in a bleſſed connexion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.10. So they differ but in degree, not in Specie; Grace is Glory begun, Glory is Grace conſummated; Grace is the Bud, Glory is the Flower: this New Creature is the Key of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the inlet into Glory: yea, it is Salvation already, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us.</hi> This bleſſed work of the New Creature is a <hi>quickning together with Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>raiſeth us up together, and makes us ſit together in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> And thus we are ſaved in our Repreſentative, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.5, 6, 7. yea, this Divine Principle is an Heaven begun, not only as a Pledge, but part of it. The Scripture often tells us, that God's Children have Eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. And this is, 1. [<hi>in precio</hi>] in price, for it is a purchaſed Poſſeſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14.2. [<hi>in promiſſo</hi>] in promiſe, for God hath promiſed

So it was but a Sign, no proper Cauſe, which would have had its certain Effect. 3. If Baptiſm were the Cauſe of Regeneration, then no unbaptized Children were regenerate, and ſo could not be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:37116:39"/>ſaved, if dying in Innocency; but <hi>David</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his Child's Salvation, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. tho' not Circumciſed, by vertue of the Covenant. 4. It is a groundleſs Popiſh Doctrine, to think that Sacraments confer Grace, [<hi>ex opere operato</hi>] meerly becauſe uſed, that they ſtamp an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Character on the Party baptized, its but an External Act, and cannot reach the Heart or Conſcience, no more then Old Teſtament Rites could do, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1, 3. Nor is it in the power of the holieſt Miniſter on Earth, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in Heaven; its God's prerogative, and he is a free Agent, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. to work or ſuſpend his Grace.</p>

The Goſpel-preaching is <hi>the Power of God to Salvation;</hi> yet all are not ſaved by it: <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Jam. 5.3. Yet all that hear, do not believe; <hi>For who hath believed our Report?</hi> Ordinances are but Channels, not Springs of Grace; the Bleſſing upon them depends only on Soveraign Grace: how many Thouſands have gone to Hell with Baptiſmal Water on their Face! <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael, Eſau,</hi> and all the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that were uncircumciſed in Heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.26.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In the Root or Principle, begot by a Saving change from Nature to Grace; carnal men, though they have never ſo fair a Flower, yet want the <hi>Root of the matter,</hi> John 19.27. This unſoundneſs of Heart is the Hair in the Moraliſts Pen that blurs all his fair Writing; as he ſaid of a Perſon of ſuch and ſuch Vertues [<hi>tamen est Romanus</hi>] yet he's a Leper, as was ſaid of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian;</hi> ſtill graceleſs, unprincipled. 2. In the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, <hi>Zechariah and</hi> Elizabeth <hi>walked in all the Commandments of the Lord;</hi> Luk. 1.6. But of the Moraliſt and Hypocrite it may be ſaid, <hi>the Legs of the Lame are not equal:</hi> they are addicted to halting and halving: they are always partial, ſeem excellent in one Grace, but defective in another; yea, totally want what is eſſentially neceſſary to conſtitute a Saint: The Moraliſt is defective in compliance with the firſt Table of the Law, the Hypocrite with the Second: but the New Creature lies ſquare to all Commands and Duties at all times, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.3. The New Creature acts for a right End, God's glory and communion with him, but the Moraliſt and Hypocrite always, and in every action hath a ſquint Eye at himſelf, profit, pleaſure, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as <hi>Jehu</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees.</hi> 4. The New Creature always improves Jeſus Chriſt, both for aſſiſtance and acceptance, the Moraliſt and Hypocrite ſtand upon their own Legs, and think their Penny current Money with God; but the gracious Soul denys himſelf in all; his <hi>Works are wrought in God,</hi> John 3.21. <hi>He is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the beloved,</hi> Eph. 1.6. <hi>In the Lord ſhall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:37116:40"/>all the ſeed of</hi> Iſrael <hi>be juſtified, and ſhall glory,</hi> Iſa. 45.25.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Qu. <hi>Wherein lies the difference betwixt this New Creature, which conſiſts in Sanctification, and the ſtate of Juſtification?</hi> The Reaſon of this Query, is becauſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> and ſome others con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. The New Creature in Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is an Inherent Work done within us; <hi>A New Spirit will I put within you,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. And <hi>the Kingdom of God is within you,</hi> Luk. 17.21. And though at firſt it be immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by the Spirit, yet the Chriſtian is an Agent in promoting his Sanctification, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1.1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. they may and muſt cleanſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But now Juſtification is a Work done without us by the Lord Chriſt, with his Father, by his Satisfaction of Divine Juſtice on the Croſs, and by his Interceſſion at God's Right Hand, we have <hi>Redemption through his Blood, the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sins,</hi> Epheſ. 1.7. The Red Lines of Chriſt's Blood, blot out the Black Lines of our Sins out of God's Debt-book; he <hi>waſheth us from our Sins in his own Blood,</hi> 1 John 1.7. Rev. 1.5. He <hi>was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſon or Thing is interpoſed, no Faith it ſelf, as a Work, hath not any cauſality in this Work, its only God's free Work of Grace for Chriſt's ſake to forgive Sins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The New Creature in Sanctification, is not wrought in the ſame meaſure or degree in all the Saints of God, ſome that are ſincere, come far ſhort of others; there are <hi>ſome Babes, others
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37116:41"/>strong men,</hi> Heb. 5.13, 14. It's ſaid of ſome Kings of <hi>Iſrael, there was none like them,</hi> Neh. 7.2. <hi>Hananiah feared God above many:</hi> There was none like <hi>Job in the Earth,</hi> Job 1.8. So there was different products of the Seed, yet all in good Ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.23. Some Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Faith, Love, Humility, Patience, Knowledge, Mortification, others are defective. But Juſtification is alike to all, <hi>and upon all that believe, for there is no difference,</hi> Rom. 3.22. The meaneſt weakeſt Believer hath as large a Store as the ſtrongeſt: <hi>I write unto you little Children, becauſe your Sins are forgiven you for his Name's ſake,</hi> 1 John 2.12. They are as much juſtified as Fathers and Young Men: <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Penitent Thief, are as much juſtified as <hi>Peter:</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe they are all <hi>partakers of like precious Faith,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.1. The leaſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure whereof attains its End of receiving Chriſt, as the greater; for it's Chriſt received by Faith that juſtifies: a weak Hand may receive a Gift as well as the ſtronger, though not ſo ſteaddily; but its the Gift that inricheth, not the ſtrength of the Hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The New Creature comes on by degrees, its not compleat, as it ſhall be, at the firſt inſtant; it's firſt an Embryo, Chriſt formed in the Heart, and then <hi>increaſeth with the increaſe of God,</hi> till it come <hi>to a perfect man,</hi> Col. 2.19. <hi>to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.13. The Apoſtle thanks God for the <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that their <hi>Faith did grow exceedingly,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.3. <hi>and Charity:</hi> Its like the Sun that <hi>ſhineth more and more to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. A
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:37116:41"/>good Man <hi>grows ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. But now Juſtification is compleat at firſt, every whit as much at firſt ingrafting into Chriſt, as afterwards: All that <hi>believe, are juſtified from all things,</hi> Acts 13.39. <hi>No Condemnation can be laid in againſt them,</hi> Rom. 8.1. He <hi>forgiveth all treſpaſſes, blotting out the hand-writing,</hi> Col. 2.13, 14. God throughly <hi>waſheth away his Childrens blood,</hi> Ezek. 16.9. There's not a Spot to be ſeen on them, no Charge can be drawn up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>Why then are Chriſt's Diſciples bound to pray daily for Pardon?</hi> Matth. 6.12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Becauſe we are daily committing new Sins, in <hi>many things we offend all,</hi> James 3.2. We miſs it in every thing: Oh, how <hi>many are our ſecret Faults,</hi> Pſal. 19.12.2. God would have us daily lie under the ſence of our former guilt, the deſert of Sin, and the worth of pardoning Grace; <hi>David</hi> was aſſured of Pardon by <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. yet afterwards prays for it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.2. The prodigal Son confeſſeth his fault, after his Father had fallen on his Neck, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20, 21.3. Pardoning Grace may be clouded in the ſence and aſſurance of it, and in this reſpect the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs <hi>of God is revealed from Faith to Faith, Rom.</hi> 1.17. From a leſs to a ſtronger Faith. Beſides, 4. We may diſtinguiſh betwixt a juſtified State, and applications of Pardon to Souls, <hi>there is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs with God,</hi> which muſt be daily ſued out by Faith and Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another difference betwixt this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Juſtification, is, that the Grace of the New Creature is never perfect in this Life; the holieſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:37116:42"/>Saints have ſome Spots, and defects, who can <hi>ſay, I have made my Heart clean,</hi> Prov. 20.9. <hi>I am pure from my Sin?</hi> Eccle. 7.20. <hi>There's not a just man on Earth, that doth good, and ſinneth not,</hi> Mat. 3.14. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> needs a New Baptiſm; all the Diſciples need their firſt waſhing, <hi>John</hi> 13. A <hi>Paul</hi> complains of a Body of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. Its in Heaven only that the <hi>Spirits of just men are made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. Bat Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is perfect; there's no Spot in the juſtified <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Fair as the Moon,</hi> Cant. 6.10. [as to Sanctification] <hi>clear as the Sun</hi> [in reſpect of Juſtification] <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. white as Snow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.17. God deals with them, as if they had never offended, <hi>caſting their Sins behind his Back, into the depth of the Sea,</hi> Mich. 7.18. <hi>Remembers them no more,</hi> Jer. 31.34.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But doth not God puniſh his for Sin?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe are not properly Acts of Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive Juſtice, but Fatherly Chaſtiſements, coming from God, not as a Judge upon a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, but as an indulgent Father to his wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and way-ward Child. Its true, Afflictions are materially the Curſe, but formally a Bleſſing, being like a Water running through the bleſſed Mineral of Covenant-Love. With reference to this Pardoning Grace,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ames <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dul.</hi> p. 139.</note> its worth noting what D. <hi>Ames</hi> obſerves, that there's fourfold Pardon; 1ſt. In God's decree and purpoſe, foreſeeing it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.8. 2dly. In Chriſt's undertakings, our Sins laid on him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. 3dly. Virtually upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians firſt Relation to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. 4thly. Expreſly applied upon the Believers Repentance,

And I may add, there's a Day of publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming this Pardon before the whole World, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your Sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>

I thank God, I am no Turn-coat, nor will I meddle with them that are given to change, I love the old way.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Take that Text with you, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 6.16. <hi>Stand ye in the ways, and ſee, and ask for the Old Paths, where is the good old way, and walk therein.</hi> Mark it, not ſimply the Old Way, except it be good; for there are many old ways that are not good: <hi>Cain</hi>'s way is old enough, ſo was <hi>Balaam</hi>'s and <hi>Core</hi>'s, yet there's a Woe unto them that walk in thoſe ways, <hi>Jude</hi> 11.

God anſwers them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, Ver. 21.22. But let me ſay to you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Plea is a multiplication of the Fault; if it be not a good way, every Step you take in it, is a new Error, and brings new guilt, [<hi>vetuſtas Erroris ſeductio Errantis] The way of the Wicked ſeduceth him.</hi> Have you examin'd, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be God's way or no?

               <p>I ſhall briefly propound and Anſwer the Pleas, that may make for their pretence.</p>
               <p>1ſt. Plea. <hi>I have heard that the New Creature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Knowledge, and I thank God that hath given me a large ſhare of that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> We <hi>know that we all have knowledge,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.1. Tit. 1.16. What kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is yours? Devils have more knowledge then you, yet are not, nor ever can be New Creatures: a Toad hath a Pearl in its Head, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it's Body; thouſands go knowingly to Hell, and the more knowledge without Grace, the more torment, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.47.</p>
               <p>2d. Plea. <hi>But I believe the Revelations of God, give credit to the Goſpel, I can ſay the Creed, am Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, no Heretick.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:37116:45"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That's well ſo far; but read <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.17—to ver. 25. What canſt thou ſay of thy ſelf more then this profeſſing <hi>Jew,</hi> that <hi>reſted in the Law, made his boaſt of God, approved of things more excellent;</hi> who yet was condemned as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious, ſelf-contradicting, God-diſhonouring wretch: but thou believeſt, ſo doth <hi>the Devil believe and tremble,</hi> James 2.19. Thou mayſt have an Orthodox Head, and Heterodox Feet.</p>
               <p>3d. Plea. <hi>I am come of Religious Parents, that improved, pleaded the Covenant for me, trained me up in the Fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. John Baptiſt</hi> anticipates this Plea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay in your Hearts, We have</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham <hi>to our Father,</hi> Matth. 8.12. <hi>The Children of the Kingdom may be caſt into utter Darkneſs.</hi> Alas Parental Privileges without Parents Principles, ſignifie nothing: Let our Lord Chriſt, who will be Judge, anſwer this vain Plea, <hi>John</hi> 8.33-44. This may aggravate your Sin, never ſave your Souls, without Perſonal Piety.</p>
               <p>4th. Plea. <hi>I have made a credible Profeſſion of my Faith, am Baptized, am admitted to the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, joyn with God's People.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So did <hi>Simon Magus</hi> believe, profeſſed his Faith, was Baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13.20-23. deceiv'd the pureſt Church on Earth, for he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a rotten Hypocrite; ſo did <hi>Judas,</hi> ſo did he that wanted the Wedding Garment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12. And how eaſie it is to caſt a Miſt before the Eyes of fallible men, daily experience teſtifies: See an Inſtance of ſome that partake of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Privileges, Ordinances, yet rejected, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:37116:46"/>
               <p>5th Plea. <hi>Yea, but I am not only admitted, but continue long with them, hold up Society with them in publick, private Exerciſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So did the Fooliſh Virgins accompany the Wiſe, till the laſt Hour, with ſhining Lamps, and when the Bridegroom came, they all trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lamps, but at laſt it was found, they had no Oyl in their Veſſels, and ſo were ſhut out; ſee <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1-12. And do you not read of ſome that pertinaciouſly maintain their Plea to the very laſt, when the Door is ſhut, and ſtill begin to ſay, <hi>We have eat and drunk in thy preſence,</hi> —Luke 13.25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>6th. Plea <hi>But I have had great Convictions of Conſcience for the evil of Sin, Juſtice of God; theſe ſure were pangs of the New Birth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw. Cain</hi> had theſe legal terrors, yet was naught; ſo had <hi>Saul,</hi> ſo <hi>Judas;</hi> yea, <hi>Felix</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled upon <hi>Paul</hi>'s preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25. And all theſe were but as [<hi>praejudicium judicij</hi>] fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtes of that horrible Vengeance in the other World. Some Sinners have a <hi>fearful looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation,</hi> Heb. 10.27. Oh look to your coming out of your Horrors of Conſcience; ſee you cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>7th. Plea. <hi>Yes, I have had ſtrong perſwaſions in my Breaſt to cloſe with Chriſt, and do take him by Faith to be my Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> An <hi>almoſt Perſwaſion</hi> is one thing, and a thorough Reſolution is another, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.27, 28. Some barter, but buy not this Pearl of Pirce, ſome are content with a Chriſt to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and ſave them, but like him not as a King to rule them, and mortifie their Luſts: look
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:37116:46"/>to it, there's more ſorts of Faith then ſaving: the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth a man to have all Faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. Yet not that which worketh by Love, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. Feigned Faith is one thing, Unfeigned is another.</p>
               <p>8th. Plea. <hi>But I confeſs all my Sins, from the bottom of my Heart, repent of them, and am heartily ſorry I have done amiſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> So have many Hypocrites, Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; ſo did <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.27. <hi>I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous,</hi> and I and my <hi>People are wicked,</hi> 1 Sam. 24.16, 17-26.21. Twice did <hi>Saul</hi> confeſs his Folly; yea, lift up his Voice, and wept, and ingenuouſſy ſaid, <hi>I have ſinned.</hi> So did <hi>Ahab</hi> humble himſelf, <hi>King.</hi> 21.27. And you find <hi>Judas</hi> repenting himſelf; yea, reſtoring, and ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying Innocent Blood,</hi> Matth. 27 34. Oh ſee yours be not a worldly Sorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</p>
               <p>9th. Plea. <hi>But I take up ſtrong Reſolutions of better and new Obedience, and do actually reform; is not this the New Creature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> No, the New Creature always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth Reformation, but Reformation may be without the New Creature; <hi>Herod feared</hi> John Baptiſt, <hi>and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly,</hi> Mark 6.20. Partial Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is no ſound Evidence of Regeneration: the unclean Spirit of ſcandalous ſinning may go out of the Devil's Slave for a Seaſon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43-45. Men <hi>may eſcape groſs Pollutions,</hi> yet be intangled in the Devil's Fetters, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 20.23.</p>
               <p>10th. Plea. <hi>I do not only Reform, but alſo Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37116:47"/>to the Will of God, in keeping all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; this ſurely ſhews Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, if done from a right Principle, according to rule, for a right end, with Faith in Jeſus Chriſt: but deceive not your ſelves, outward Compliance doth not always teſtifie a New Creature, the Young Gentleman in <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.20. ſaid concerning the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>All theſe things have I kept from my Youth up, what lack I yet?</hi> Alas poor man, he lacked the main: <hi>Paul,</hi> before Converſion, ſaith of himſelf, <hi>touching the Righteouſneſs of the law, blameleſs,</hi> Phil. 3.6.</p>
               <p>11th. Plea. <hi>But I do not only Reform, Conform; but I Perform many good Duties; I Read, Pray, Faſt, am ſerious in God's Worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's well ſo far; all do not ſo: but remember thoſe Hypocrites in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.2. <hi>That ſought God daily, delighted to know his ways—yea, the Phariſees made long Prayers,</hi> Matth. 23.14. Yea, they <hi>faſted, and that twice a Week,</hi> Luke 18.11,12. They were famous for Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, yet groſs Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>12th. Plea. <hi>Thoſe were only for Externals in Religion, but I am for Internals alſo, that God may have my Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Very well; but it's one thing to be ſound in the Doctrinals, another to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in Practicals, Experimentals; it's one thing to ſay it, another thing to feel it, and do it: The Scribe in <hi>Mark</hi> 12.32, 33. ſubſcribed to the Truth of this great Doctrine of <hi>Loving the Lord with all the Heart, Underſtanding, Soul, and Strength, and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:37116:47"/>repeats it,</hi> yet was not of, but <hi>only, not far from the Kingdom of God,</hi> verſ. 34. Yea, you may take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in approaching to God, yet be bad, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 38.2.</p>
               <p>13th. Plea. <hi>But I am upright in what I do: I know nothing to my ſelf but Integrity; Conſcience doth not accuſe me to be an Hypocrite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It may be ſo, becauſe Conſcience may be aſleep, and ſaith nothing, or nothing to the purpoſe, being blinded with Ignorance, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted with ſelf-conceit, and want of ſelf-ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But know, there may be a moral Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in particular Acts, when there is not a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-integrity in point of State, as in Heathen <hi>Abimelech:</hi> ſee God's atteſtation to it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.5, 6.</p>
               <p>14th. Plea. <hi>I have a Love to God, Jeſus Chriſt, and follow him out of my dear and tender reſpects to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's well if ſo, but is it not ſelf-love that engageth you to follow him? as thoſe, <hi>John</hi> 6.26. <hi>Ye ſeek me, not becauſe ye ſaw the Miracles, but becauſe ye did eat of the Loaves, and were filled.</hi> Aug. complained 1200 Years ago [<hi>vix diligitur Jeſus propter Jeſum</hi>] Jeſus is ſcarcely loved for Jeſus ſake: he pays well for his Entertainment in the World's Coyn: Let Chriſt and Carnal Intereſt part, and then you'l ſee what is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter you'l follow; then a diſcovery will be made.</p>
               <p>15th Plea. <hi>Well, but I have ſuffered much for Chriſt, his Cauſe, and a Good Conſcience, a tryal hath been made of my Integrity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You have not yet reſiſted unto Blood, ſtriving againſt Sin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.4. Yea, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:37116:48"/>ſeems to ſuppoſe a Man may give his Body to be burnt; and yet not have Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. And it may be as poſſible, ſome may ſuffer in an humor for a good Cauſe, as others pertinaciouſly in a bad; the Thorny Ground Hearers paſt the brunt of Perſecution, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 22. falling on the Stony Ground, but were naught. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the <hi>Galatians</hi> to <hi>have ſuffered many things in vain,</hi> Gal. 3.4. Many things make up a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſufferer. Men may bear the Croſs, and not follow Chriſt.</p>
               <p>16th. Plea. <hi>But I give liberally to the Poor of my Subſtance, am much in the exerciſe of Charity to perſons in neceſſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth ſtill, that a Man may beſtow all his Goods to feed the Poor, yet not have Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. You'l ſay this is a ſtrange Paradox; what is Charity, but a free diſtribution? But the Apoſtle diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, betwixt an Hand-Charity and a Heart-Charity; the poor Widow with half a Farthing, and a free Heart gave more then all the other rich mens large diſtributions, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1, 2. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.41, 44. Some give for Oſtentation, others of Neceſſity; yea, out of Covetouſneſs; you give nothing, unleſs you give your ſelves firſt to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5, 7.2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5.</p>
               <p>17th. Plea. <hi>I am forward for Reformation in my place, appear against Prophaneneſs, Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and am of a publick Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's well done, but ſee you miſtake not; how oft did the <hi>Jews</hi> find fault with our Lord for healing on the Sabbath day, and his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37116:48"/>for plucking Ears of Corn. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.1, 2. Take heed blind Zeal tranſport you not: but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it be againſt Sin, ſee whether Self bear not ſway, as it did <hi>Jehu,</hi> who was partial in his Reformation, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 10.28, 29. At leaſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary as <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was very zealous for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming, whilſt his good Uncle <hi>Jehoida</hi> lived, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.2-18.</p>
               <p>18th. Plea. <hi>I thank God, I have good Gifts in Diſcourſe, in Prayer, and can edifie others, that are apt to admire me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Gifts are one thing, Grace another; all gifted men are not gracious men: who more eminent than <hi>Judas</hi> the traytor, yet an Apoſtle; and ſome will ſay in that day, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not propheſyed in thy Name?</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. To whom he'll ſay, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me.</hi> The Devil hath finer Gifts then any of you all: yet he's a damned Fiend in Hell: Gifts come upon another Errand than Grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. Gifts are given to profit others, Grace for a man's own Soul.</p>
               <p>19th. Plea. <hi>I am verily perſwaded I am ſound at Heart, my Conſcience flyes not in my Face, yea,</hi> I <hi>have great Peace, Joy and Comfort within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God knows whether your Peace be of the right Stamp or no: I have told you, there's a Peace of the Devil's ſpeaking, and that may ariſe from Conſcience's Sleep, Security. I now tell you of a Joy riſing from the common work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit, the <hi>ſtony Ground hearers anon with Joy received the Word,</hi> Mat. 13.20. <hi>but had no Root?</hi> Luk. 8.13.

               <p>20th. Plea. <hi>You are ſeeking to drive us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, but that I will never do, I will hope well ſtill, ſay what you will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There's a double deſpair, 1ſt. Good, and Neceſſary, a deſpair of ever being ſaved in the ſtate of Nature, wherein we are born, and this God brings the Sinner to, in order to planting ſound Hope, and ſincere Faith in the Soul; 2dly. There's an Evil, ſinful deſpair of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Mercy at God's hands through Chriſt: God forbid we ſhould drive Sinners to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: no, no, its the former we aim at. Such as <hi>Paul</hi> felt, <hi>Rom:</hi> 7.9. <hi>I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, ſin revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and I dyed;</hi> ie. I ſaw my ſelf in a damnable ſtate, no hopes of Salvation, while I continued in the ſtate of Nature: we are ſure till Souls ſee themſelves condemned, they will never look after a Pardon; it's this we drive men to: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, 2dly. there's a twofold Hope, 1. A bad, a falſe, rotten Hope, that's built upon mens Fanſie and Imagination, <hi>Job</hi> 8.14.—11.20. This will be ſwept <hi>away like a Spiders-Web, give up the Ghoſt; what hath the Hypocrite gained by his hope, when God taketh away his Soul,</hi> ch. 27.8. It's the beſt Office we can do the Sinner, to break the Heart of this groundleſs Hope; that we might bring in a better Hope: Hence, 2. There's a good <hi>Hope through Grace,</hi> an Hope <hi>that will not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37116:50"/>make aſhamed,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2.17. Rom. 5.5. An Hope that reſts upon the Promiſes of Grace in the Goſpel, its this that will do Men good at the laſt: but men muſt be ſure to obſerve and comply with the terms of the Promiſe, elſe it is groundleſs preſumption: A Prince hath as much reaſon to be offended with him that keeps not cloſe to his Commiſſion, as with another that acts without a Commiſſion: The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of Old, ſaith one, durſt make God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a Leaning-ſtock for their foul Elbows to reſt on, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.2. <hi>They call themſelves the holy City, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of Iſrael:</hi> See alſo <hi>Micah</hi> 3.11. Nothing more common, yet nothing more dangerous, for ſuch are more bold then welcome: for though a Prince may be ſo condeſcending as to let a poor Sick or Wounded Man, eſpecially in his Service, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and unable to go alone, upon his humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, make uſe of his Arm, rather then periſh in the Street, yet would reject a reeling Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, if he deſired to lean on him: thus a poor bleeding, humble Penitent is entertained, when a preſumptuous Rebel is kickt off with infinite abhorrency; we muſt incourage the former, and convince the latter, that their Hope may be daſht, and another Hope, (<hi>begot again a lively hope,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.3.1 John 3.3. that teacheth Perſons to cleanſe themſelves) be planted in the Soul: For <hi>the wicked is driven away in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but the righteous hath hope in his Death,</hi> Prov-14 32.</p>

               <p n="1">1. A Soul without this New Creature, hath no Intereſt in Chriſt; <hi>For if any man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.

You muſt mount to Heaven alone, if you think to aſcend any other way then upon the Ladder of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as <hi>Conſtantin</hi> told <hi>Aceſius</hi> long ago: its a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and its a meer Phrenſie to divide aſſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what God hath joyned ſo inviolably toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37116:57"/>Holineſs and Happineſs, a new Nature and a new State; if you rend them, God will rend you.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Its impoſſible you ſhould walk in the way to Heaven, without being New Creatures, for the End can never be attained without the Uſe of the means. Reaſon tells us, that he that would arrive at <hi>London,</hi> muſt go by Land or Water, in Ships, or on Horſeback, Coach, or on Foot, or by ſome means or other; or he can never come thither. So it is here, God hath preſcribed Means and Methods for attaining E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Happineſs, and bids us enter in <hi>at the ſtrait gate,</hi> Matth. 7.13, 14. <hi>Yea, ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate;</hi> And adds, <hi>That many ſhall ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luk. 13.24. How ſhall they then enter, that neither ſtrive, nor ſeek nor make any Eſſay to enter! And how can they ſeek or ſtrive, that have to ſtrength; nay, that have no life, as a graceleſs Soul is? who is is dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins: and till the Grace of God infuſe new Life into him, with this New Creature, he can neither ſtir Hand nor Foot in a Spiritual Senſe, Heaven-ward, and is not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to come thither.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nay, he that wants the New Creature, hath no Heart, Mind, or Will to be ſaved: and God ſaves no Man againſt his Will, but his Grace makes them truly willing; and this change of the Will is a conſiderable part of the New Creature, and 'tis a Sovereign Act of free Grace, <hi>thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy Power,</hi> Pſal 110.3. None follow the Captain of our Salvation to Heaven, but Volunteers, and there's

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37116:58"/>would go to Heaven, yes, fain you would be ſaved, but do you know what Heaven is? I will tell you briefly, Heaven conſiſts in a freedom from all Sin, a perfection of Grace, injoyment of God, employment in divine Praiſes, love, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in God, meditation on God, Ecſtacies and Raviſhment of all the Soul's Faculties in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate communion with him: And what aukard Conceptions hath a carnal Heart of theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Privileges? They would be no advantage to him at all, but a torment, to him that hates God, runs from him, cannot abide to come near him in any Duty, likes not the Society of God's Saints, delights in ſinful Practices, dallies with Satan's Temptations: Can men imagine they ſhall take Cards and Dice, Cups and Queans with them to Heaven? Nay, can Men take fair Houſes, full Bags, or worldly Buſineſs into another world? Can men make great Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, gather great Rents, or break Jeſts with their Companions in a future ſtate? Alas, a poor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal heart is weary of Duties, much more will he be in Heaven; Sermon is too long, Prayer is tedious, <hi>when will the Sabbath be gone?</hi> Can theſe be fit to enjoy God in an eternal Sabbath of reſt? nay, the poor guilty Sinner cares not for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to God, the Sight of God is terrible to him, as it was to fallen <hi>Adam:</hi> indeed without converting Grace, introducing this New Creature and Divine Nature, the Soul would be altogether ſtrange to God, and any converſe with an holy, glorious God; yea, even the ſanctified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by reaſon of the Remainders of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in them, have much ado to bring
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37116:59"/>their Hearts to converſe with God, eſpecially when they lie under the ſenſe of Guilt, even a Godly <hi>Peter</hi> then crys out, <hi>Depart from me, for I am a ſinful man, O Lord,</hi> Luk. 5.8. Much more will a graceleſs Soul not dare to come near to God; <hi>an Hypocrite ſhall not come before him</hi> Job 13.16. He will not, and God will not ſuffer him: but a gracious Heart can truly ſay, <hi>It is good for me to draw nigh to God,</hi> Pſal. 73.28. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God is his Heaven upon Earth: Therefore this God will be his Salvation, himſelf is his beſt Heaven: but a carnal Heart knows not what this means, and is therefore uncapable of Heaven.</p>

It can diſcover moral Good and Evil, yea, <hi>it can excuſe or accuſe in what you do,</hi> good or amiſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. You might be much better if you minded this Light within you, the Light of Natural Conſcience: How can you expect more, till you improve what you have: Nature can do little towards Grace, yet Moral Principles cheriſhed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, may be ſome Fence againſt vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, and prevent a Cuſtom in ſinful Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices; however, its dangerous to impriſon the common Notices of a Deity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. or Moral Duty; this is the Road to obliterate them, this ſhuts the Door againſt Grace, and opens the Sluce of Vice: nouriſh what's good in thee; who can tell what it may come to at laſt?</p>

               <p>There's one thing I fear more than all the reſt, and that is a lazy, ſloathful, luskiſh Spirit, that will not take any Pains in God's Work, nor in the concerns of the Soul, but think Grace muſt drop into their gaping Mouths; this Sloath hath killed thouſands of Sinners: Oh, it will coſt him trouble, care, pains, and this he cannot brook. And do Men think to grow Rich without labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:37116:65"/>careful Endeavours, and travelling to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets? And can they think to go to Heaven, or get Grace without taking Pains? Its true, its not meerly Pains that will do it, but Sloath will loſe it; and without Pains-taking, nothing that's excellent will be obtained; for [<hi>Difficilia quae pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chra</hi>] The more choice things are, the hardlier are they come by. I am ſure Chriſtians of Old <hi>laboured hard,</hi> that <hi>they might be accepted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.9. And the Apoſtle tells the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that <hi>God doth not forget their work and labour of Love:</hi> and <hi>urgeth them to ſhew the ſame diligence, and not be ſloathful, but followers of them, who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Let the ſlothful Perſon ask himſelf theſe Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions; 1. Whether the Pains of Hell be not more intolerable than the Pains God calls for from him to eſcape it? Or, 2. Whether Heaven will not requite all his Pains to obtain it? Or, 3. Whether he take not more pains to ſcrape toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little Dirt of Wealth, or a neceſſary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Wants? Or, 4. Whether thouſands take not more pains to get to Hell, then God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of him to travel to Heaven? And let the wretched Sluggard know, that by that time he hath been an Hour in thoſe intolerable. Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he would be glad to be turned into the World again, though upon the hardeſt terms of Obedience, Mortification, and acting all things within the verge of an humane Capacity; would he not gladly accept the Conditions, in order to Eternal Life? But alas, Men are made up ſo much of Senſe, and underſtand ſo little of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:37116:66"/>Inviſible Realities, that they chuſe rather to be damned Eternally, than to endeavour to live Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily: therefore <hi>mens deſtruction is of themſelves,</hi> Hoſ. 13.9.

That's a true Maxim [<hi>nemo nolens bonus aut beatus eſt</hi>] It is God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, that men's own eſtimation, choice, and endeavours ſhall be the neceſſary preparative to their Fruition: and hence, it is <hi>that the ſlothful Servant was a wicked Servant,</hi> and fared and <hi>ſped according to his Sloth,</hi> Matth. 25.26.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is of very great Concernment for every Rational Soul to know, and be at ſome certainty whether he be a New Creature.</p>
               <p>I might here refer the Reader to the Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it in the beginning. 1. I called it a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace, as to the general Nature of it. 2. For its particular Property, or Nature, I call'd it a Goſpel-Grace, in its ſpecifial quality. 3. As to its ſubject, it is in the Soul of a Sinner. 4. The Inſtrumental Cauſe of it, is the Word of God. 5. The Efficient Cauſe, is the Holy Ghoſt. 6. The proper immediate Effect, is a great change. 7. The Compleatneſs of this change, in point of ſtate, Conſtitution, Relation. 8. The Pattern is the divine Image or Likeneſs. 9. The Rule of it, which is the Word of God. 10. The End, 'tis the Glory of God, and the Soul's Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinneſs in its communion with God.</p>
               <p>You ſee then this New Creature is a very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and comprehenſive thing, it contains the whole Encuclopaedia, (as I may ſay) or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of Experimental and Practical Religion.</p>
               <p>It is a Relation, not one quality, nor yet one ſingle habit, neither one Star, nor yet a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation of Graces, but a Relation or Rectitude, and orderly Correſpondence of the Faculties ſtraining forth from the infuſion of all thoſe Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Qualities into Man,

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:37116:67"/>this inward Principle, not compleatly or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in point of degree, as it was in <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul, in the ſtate of Innocency, but by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the parts, ſo far as the Soul is ſanctifyed in this Life, and compleated to a perfect Man in Heaven: It is (ſay Divines) [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] a Spiritual Chain, wherein all Vertues and Graces are linked, concreated with <hi>Adam,</hi> infuſed into the Chriſtian in this New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, whereby he hath a power to act as a Chriſtian, in this lower World, in all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Exerciſes, that God in his Word calls him to.</p>

               <p>A Touch of each.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the Preparatives or Antecedents that lead to the New Creature; not that the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture can prepare himſelf for it, but the ſame God that makes it, doth ſomething on the Soul to uſher it in, as the Chaos and Darkneſs was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the beautiful Fabrick of the World: ſo God works.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sence of Sin, Wrath, and the undone eſtate the Soul is in, this is a New York; for formerly the Sinner nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the Sinner crys, <hi>Wo is me, I am undone, I never thought I had been in this miſerable ſtate: I ſee I am a condemned Malefactor at the dreadful Bar of a Sin-revenging Judge: my Mouth is ſtopt, I have not a Word to ſay for my ſelf, why Sentence ſhould not be executed upon me: Wo is me, I am likely to periſh for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. A diſcovery of his helpleſs ſtate, he himſelf cannot help or deliver himſelf, the whole World cannot; its not within the power of Men or Angels to bring any Relief to his forlorn, periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul; I am, ſaith the poor Sinner, helpleſs, <hi>fatherleſs, Hoſ.</hi> 14.13.

I could provoke God, but I cannot pleaſe him; Heaven is ſhut againſt me, and I have no Key to open it: Hell gapes for me, and I know not how to eſcape it: I hang over Flames, I lie in Chains, and all the World cannot break them, <hi>Silver and Gold will not redeem me,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Great men are vanity, good men</hi> have no Oyl to ſpare, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.9. It I ſate upon a Prince's Throne, I could not purchaſe or command a Pardon, <hi>The redemption of the Soul is precious, it ceaſeth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 49.7. My caſe grows worſe and worſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A ſerious Enquiry after a Remedy, when the poor Sinner is thus puzzled and non-pluſt, and knows not which way to turn himſelf, then he begins to ask new Queſtions, not as he was wont, <hi>Who will ſhew me any good,</hi> Pſal. 4.6. of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:37116:68"/>worldly advantage; no, but his Tune is turned, now he cries, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall I do?</hi> Acts 23.16, 30. Oh Sirs, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Oh, you Miniſters, Chriſtian Friends, did you ever know any caſe like mine? Is it poſſible that ever I ſhould find Mercy? Is not the Day of Grace paſt?

               <p n="4">4. Sad thoughts of heart upon diſcovery of the Remedy: Oh, ſaith the poor Sinner, you tell me God is a <hi>merciful God, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> Exod. 34.6, 7. But I ſpy one Red Letter in his Name [<hi>that will by no means clear the Guilty</hi>]. Now I am guilty, and I have read that the Arms of Juſtice and Mercy are of equal length, both infinite; how muſt Juſtice be ſatisfied? I am ſure not by me, in my own Perſon. Well, the Goſpel tells the Sinner, that the Wards of the Lock are changed; this Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery will relieve the condemned Sinner; Chriſt in our room hath ſuffered and ſatisfied Juſtice for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.5.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. Yea, faith the Soul, but how ſhall I have Intereſt therein? Its anſwered, By Faith. Alas, ſaith the Sinner, I am but where I was, I can no more believe, then I can keep the whole Law: Oh this unbelieving Heart kills me, binds me over to Wrath: ſtill I would believe, but I cannot, my <hi>Faith is but Unbelief,</hi> Mark 9.24. I thought believing was

               <p n="5">5. Obſtructions are at laſt removed; a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Will by Grace, is made <hi>willing in the Day of God's Power,</hi> Pſal. 110.3. Now Prejudices are removed: though a <hi>Nathaniel</hi> ſay, <hi>Can there any good come out of Nazareth?</hi> John 1.46, 49. Yet if he come and ſee, he will believe: This was the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>'s caſe, <hi>John</hi> 49.19. Alas faith the Soul, I have been fooliſh, and ready to pick Quarrels at God's way of juſtifying and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poor Sinners, and ſaid of the Goſpel-Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, how can theſe things be? But I am at laſt ſatisfied, that a Revelation from God is not only authentick, but moſt rational; but yet I have within me ſtrange Imaginations, and <hi>high things that exalt themſelves againſt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God.</hi> Well, God comes with his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Weapons, and pulls down theſe ſtrong holds, diſmounts the Sinner's carnal Confidence, and levels theſe high Mountains of Oppoſition, <hi>leads captivity captive,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.45. And now the Sinner is content, that God ſhould take his own method in juſtifying and ſaving a Sinner by the Merits of Chriſt, without the leaſt reſpect to any worthineſs in him: and there's much ado to bring the proud Heart to this, to forego his own Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Reſtleſneſs of Spirit in its preſent ſtate, the Sinner is now heavy laden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. muſt have reſt ſomewhere, but can enjoy no reſt in

This is not a ſtate to be reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, faith the trembling Soul, I am got off all bottoms, I ſee my old unregenerate ſtate hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and deplorable, yet I fear I am not centred and anchored on Chriſt, the Rock of Ages; Wo is me, I am fluctuating on the Waves betwixt Hope and Deſpair, I fear the iſſue: ſometimes I ſpy the Day-break, but Clouds and Darkneſs overwhelm me again: however, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with theſe poor Husks of the World in my Chriſtleſs ſtate in a far Country, <hi>I will ariſe and go to my Father,</hi> Luke 15.17. In this tumultuous Sea, I find no bottom for the Sole of my Foot, I muſt make to Ship or Shore; none but Chriſt, none but Chriſt, let me have him, though with <hi>Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from without, and Fears within.</hi> I am ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Poſt to Pillar, let me be diſſettled till my Soul fix on Chriſt, <hi>then ſhall not my Heart be troubled, if believing in God, I believe alſo in Chriſt,</hi> John 14.1.

               <p n="7">7. At laſt the troubled Spirit iſſues out its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed Thoughts in Complaints and Prayers: God faith, <hi>I have ſurely hearth</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf,</hi> Jer. 31.18. So methinks I ſee the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted Soul creep into a Corner to eaſe his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened Spirit into God's Boſom in this manner: Lord, here I am, as wicked a Malefactor as ever ſtood at thy Bar, and as miſerable a Beggar as

I find not one word in Scripture againſt it, but a Proclamation of a general Pardon to all: Chriſt with all his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits is offered to me in the Miniſtry of the Word, upon the condition of Faith and Repentance: Its true, I can neither repent nor believe, but they are both included in the abſolute Grant of the Goſpel-Covenant, which gives what it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.

               <p>Thus much for Preparatives.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Parts of this New Creature lie in the renewing of the ſeveral Faculties of the Soul, which conſiſts; 1ſt. In the Mind and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:37116:70"/>2dly. In the Conſcience; 3dly. In the Will; 4thly. In the Affections, which are the Motions of the Will.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The New Creature conſiſts much in the Mind, which is called <hi>a renewing in the Spirit of the Mind,</hi> Eph. 4.23. Interpreters have been much perplexed to know what is meant by the Spirit of the Mind, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſaith [<hi>Ego Simpliciter acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,

For the Mind is accounted a Queen, and almoſt adored by Philoſophers. Now the Mind is renewed, when there is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. New Conceptions of things, otherwiſe than ever before, for a new Light ſet up in the Soul, to ſee things after another manner, <hi>the eyes of the underſtanding are now enlightned,</hi> Eph. 1.18. Now he ſees more Wickedneſs in his bad Heart, then ever he did, which makes him cry out, as <hi>Job, Behold I am vile,</hi> Job 40.4. <hi>Lord, thou art Heaven, I am Hell,</hi> ſaid Mr. <hi>Hooper.</hi> Now the Soul ſees more Poyſon and Malignity in Sin, then ever before, he ſees it <hi>exceeding ſinful,</hi> Rom. 7.9, 17. As ſtriking at the Majeſty, clouding the Glory of the Holy God, as crucifying Chriſt, grieving the holy Spirit. The New Creature begets other Conceptions of Chriſt, as the <hi>Roſe of Sharon,</hi> Cant 5.9. <hi>the chief of ten thouſand.</hi> He looks on God's Commands as <hi>not at all grievous,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:37116:70"/>1 John 5.3. but pleaſant, comfortable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; he looks on the Saints as the <hi>moſt excellent in the Earth,</hi> Pſal. 16.3. Prov. 3.18. He hath got Eye-Salve to judge of things as they are: <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The New Nature bringeth a New Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he forgets Injuries, and remembers Truths; his Memory is ſanctified and fortified, he lays up things in his Heart, as the Pot of Manna was laid up in the Ark: he <hi>can abundantly utter the Memory of God's great goodneſs,</hi> Pſal. 145.7. The New Creature is as a Phylactery to prompt and put him in mind of God's Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.39. If he hath not a great Memory, yet he hath a good Memory: God brings Sins to remembrance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many Years ago, and the Soul is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for them, as if but newly committed: and though ſometimes the beſt of God's Children are ſubject to ſlippery Memories, and do need Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors, yet they have Minds clarified, and apt to be tenacious of the things of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. <hi>I ſtir up your pure minds by way remembrance.</hi> An hint will bring God and good things into their Thoughts again: but wicked men are deſcribed by this Character of <hi>forgetting God, Pſal.</hi> 50.22. Do you make it your buſineſs to remember God upon your Beds, and in all Places, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The New Creature hath a new Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; formerly the Soul conſulted with carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and baſe and by-ends, even in things of Religion, if the Practice of Religion did croſs his low and ſelfiſh Deſigns, he laid it down; but as ſoon as this Principle is put within him, he ſaith as <hi>Paul,</hi> immediately, <hi>I conferred not with
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37116:71"/>Fleſh and Blood,</hi> Gal. 1.16. God's glory, the good of his own and others Souls lay uppermoſt. Now the Chriſtian goes to the Sanctuary in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous caſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.14. and makes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (thoſe divine Oracles) <hi>the chief Counſellors,</hi> Pſal. 119.24 in his Works, Natural, Civil, Spiritual; and dare venture upon nothing but what he hath warrant from God for: not, What ſaith this Friend, or the other Relation; but what ſaith God in the caſe, directly, or by good Conſequence? See the difference betwixt good <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> and <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.5, 6. the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſaid, <hi>Enquire, I pray thee, at the Word of the Lord to day.</hi> The other made nothing of it: <hi>they ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. The New Creature hath new Admiration; the Carnal Heart wonders at trifling Novelties; <hi>David</hi> prays, <hi>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold wondrous things out of thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.18. There indeed he ſpies wonders of Power, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Holineſs, Faithfulneſs, and a diſplay of all God's Attributes, but eſpecially of free Grace and Love in the Work of Redemption: he ſees no reaſon to admire any thing, but <hi>things the Angels deſire to look into,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. and are in continual ecſtacy in the admiration of: O the Love of God in ſending Chriſt, of Chriſt in becoming Man, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. in taking any of the Sons of Men to be the Children of God, [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] Oh <hi>the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God,</hi> Rom. 11.33. There there only is ſomething to be admired: all the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:37116:71"/>Glories of the World are but meer contemptible Pageantry, he can trample them under his Feet with a better diſdain, then <hi>Diogenes</hi> trampled on <hi>Plato</hi>'s bravery, for he is in a ſort <hi>crucified to the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14.2 Cor. 4.18. And can paſs by things, ſeen with an holy ſcorn, compared with things unſeen, which are Eternal.</p>
               <p>This is the New Creature in the Mind.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The New Creature is alſo manifeſt in the Conſcience, which though it be not a diſtinct Faculty, (but a compound of more) yet it is of great uſe in the Soul of Man, and its neceſſary that <hi>the Heart be ſprinkled from an evil Conſcience,</hi> Heb. 10.22. which is done by the Blood of Chriſt, and that <hi>the Conſcience be purged from dead Works to ſerve the living God;</hi> and this is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Eternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. Now there are Four Offices of Conſcience, which the New Creature doth in good meaſure rectifie.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As it is [<hi>Index</hi>] a guide, a diſcoverer of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a bright Star in a dark Night, an Hand in the Margin, to ſhew us what is worth our obſerving, a Schoolmaſter to teach us, a Monitor to ſhew our Miſtakes; and it muſt be regulated by the Word of God; for Conſcience is corrupted, and is apt to be deceived, and deceive us: it is but an under-Officer, and muſt it ſelf be ſubject to God's Law: hence the Chriſtian ſeeks to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late its dictates by the Word of Truth, and Grace brings it to the rule; What ſaith my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Lord and Maſter, I muſt follow thee no further than God's Law allows: now the New Creature brings the Conſcience to the Word, and ſaith, Thus far thou muſt go, and no further:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:37116:72"/>the End of <hi>the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and good Conſcience, and Faith unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.5. Theſe are always Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this is a good Conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſcience is [<hi>liber</hi>] 'tis a Book, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are noted and writ down all a man's Actions, Expreſſions, yea, his Thoughts and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; ſo it is a wiſe and faithful Regiſter, to produce them, as a faithful Witneſs for, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a man another day, <hi>the Books were opened, Rev.</hi> 20.12. One of thoſe was the Book of Conſcience; Conſcience is as a thouſand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; if good, the Holy Ghoſt joyns with it, <hi>my Conſcience bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 9.1. And this <hi>is our rejoycing, the teſtimony of our Conſcience,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.12. If the Perſon have done any thing amiſs, Conſcience brings it to the man's remembrance, as the Sin of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>'s Brethren made them ſay, <hi>We are verily guilty,</hi> Gen 43.21. <hi>Now a faithful Witneſs will not lye.</hi> A rectified Conſcience will give in a true Teſtimony to promote Repentance, which is therefore called a <hi>bethinking our ſelves,</hi> 1 King. 8.47. or <hi>Heb. a bringing back upon our Hearts.</hi> Conſcience hath a tenacious Memory, and will ſpeak true in its Excuſings or Accuſings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. which is proper to Conſcience, as a Conſcience, but Grace regulates it, and adds ſome force to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As Conſcience is [<hi>judex</hi>] a Judge to paſs the Sentence upon a man, as the verdict is brought in: It's true, it is but a petty Judge under the Supreme Judge, yet the Great God confirms its judicial Sentence: 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.20. <hi>If our Hearts</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:37116:72"/>(i.e. our Conſciences) <hi>condemn us, God is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than our Hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> Every man may and muſt keep a privy Seſſions within, preparatory to the Great Aſſizes, if he be but paſſive, and is loath to hearken to this Sentence, he is ſelf-condemned; and this is but [<hi>praejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um judicij</hi>] a ſad prognoſtick of his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at God's Tribunal, which he ſeeks to eſcape, as <hi>Felix</hi> did, but cannot: But if he joyn iſſue with this Sentence, and condemn himſelf actively and voluntarily, <hi>he ſhall not be judged or condemned,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.31. Now Grace in the Heart makes a Man do this. I am the Man, ſaith Conſcience, I confeſs both the Fact and Fault. A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtthou ſo, ſaith Conſcience, I muſt needs paſs the Sentence upon thee according to God's righteous Law. Well, I yield, ſaith the Soul, I am convicted in this Court, and cannot eſcape the Judgment of God: I muſt flye to the City of Refuge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſcience is [<hi>vindex</hi>] an anvenger, a ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tormenter, a guilty Perſon is one that torments or afflicts himſelf; ſome do this ſinfully, by <hi>worldly Sorrow,</hi> which <hi>cauſeth Death,</hi> 2 Cor 7.10. The Chriſtian muſt do it penitentially, either for his own Sins, or other mens; ſo <hi>Lot vexed his righteous Soul with the Sodomites Sins,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. The Word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] he beat and Baſtinado'd his righteous Soul: The Godly Man muſt take the Whip of Conſcience with the Hand of Grace, and whip himſelf for his Sins: or God will take it with his Hand, and ſcourge him with it, as he did <hi>David,</hi> whoſe <hi>Heart ſmote him for numbring the People,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.10.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:37116:73"/>The Worm of Conſcience gnawing at the Heart, is an acute Pain, and will be one of the Torments of the Wicked in Hell, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.44. But the Godly Man prevents that by joyning iſſue with executing God's Sentence by ſelf-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating trouble for Sin here: this is a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table uſe of Conſcience, by a free and voluntary ſeconding its ſevere Laſhes to promote Godly Sorrow.</p>
               <p>This for two parts of the New Creature, that concern; <hi>firſt,</hi> the Mind; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="3">3. ANother Subject, wherein this New Creature reſides, is the Will, and this is [<hi>Cardo animae</hi>] the hinge of the Soul, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Wheel, upon which the whole Soul turns, as an old Bowl receives a new Byas, that turns it quite another way, then what it had gone: now the change of the Will is the main work of converting Grace.</p>
               <p>There are Four Motions of the Will, wherein the New Creature ſhews it ſelf,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In its Deſigns, Aims, Intentions: The world and it ſelf, were the main drift of the VVill in a natural ſtate: all ſeek their own, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. the gratifying of the Fleſh, ſenſual Appetite, and carnal Intereſt: the univerſal Inqueſt is, <hi>Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> Pſal. 4.6. Oh for a good Bargain, a cheap Purchaſe! Another is for ſtrong
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:37116:73"/>Drink, or ſweet Meats, Plays or Pleaſures; another for Cap and Knee, and Titles of Honour: But the New Creature poſt-pones and ſcorns all theſe, and deſigns the glorifying of God, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, let <hi>Chrſt be magnified, and my Soul glorified,</hi> Phil. 20. And I can hate all other things, God hath twiſted them together, and the Soul cannot part them: God is the Chriſtians chief ſupream End, in his natural, civil, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual acts; the New Man aims at the glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. Oh that my Soul may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain fellowſhip with God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. I will trample on ſinful worldly ſelf, and ſpurn away this dirty Dunghill, in compariſon of God's Glory and Salvation of my own Soul; all other things will neither pleaſe nor profit this high-bred Creature infuſed into the Soul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Elective Power of the Will, the New Creature chuſeth the moſt proper means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe high Ends, as he chuſeth God for his only End, ſo in the firſt place he chuſeth Chriſt <hi>as the only Way, Truth and Life,</hi> John 14.6.1, 51. By whom he may aſcend to God, as the Ladder of <hi>Jacob:</hi> for there's no coming to the Father, but by the Son: The Will therefore conſiſts to have Chriſt upon his own terms, and chuſeth him above the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. May I have Chriſt, I will <hi>caſt all others as Dung at my Heels,</hi> Phil. 7.7, 8, 9. Away with them, away with them, I will refuſe Crowns and Scepters in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of, or in competition with Chriſt, the New Creature comes off freely in his choice of Chriſt, is not forced to him as his laſt ſhift, to eſcape damning, but by a ſweet tendency and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:37116:74"/>propenſity of the Will touched and attracted with the Loadſtone of divine Grace, <hi>To me to live is Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.21. as well as he is good to dye with; yea, the New Creature chuſeth, the Precepts, the Promiſes, the Patterns of the Word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.30, 111. The way of Faith and Holineſs to walk in, in order to the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs; and he never repents this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Choice.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There's a cleaving act of the Will, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory, reſolved adhereing to God and his ways, the Will is fixed, determined for God, whatever ſhall be ſaid againſt; he is not off and on like <hi>a double-minded man, unſtable in all his ways,</hi> James 1.8. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] hanging in ſuſpence, <hi>halting betwixt two Opinions,</hi> 1 King. 18.21. but cleaves to the Lord with purpoſe of Heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.23. as <hi>Ruth was ſtedfaſtly minded to go with</hi> Naomi, <hi>Ruth</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. All men on Earth, and all the Devils in Hell ſhall not alter this reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: <hi>I will go and return to my Father,</hi> Luk. 15.17. <hi>I am purpoſed that my Mouth ſhall not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs,</hi> Pſal. 17.3. Let others do as they liſt, as they dare anſwer, <hi>I and my Houſe will ſerve the Lord,</hi> John 24.15. I muſt not be guided by Example or Carnal Reaſon, but by the Word of God, and having made my choice by the Grace of God, I will not be altered as long as I breath, no Sufferings ſhall daunt me, no Allurements ſhall entice me from my God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There's a reſigning act of the Will, by which it gives up it ſelf to the Will of God: the New Creature melts and molds the Will of man into the Will of God: as our Lord ſaid, <hi>Not my
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:37116:74"/>will, but thine be done,</hi> Matth. 26.39. And thoſe gracious Souls, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. ſaid, <hi>The will of the Lord be done.</hi> Hence <hi>Luther</hi> durſt Pray [<hi>fiat vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt as mea</hi>] Let my Will be done; but came off thus, Mine, Lord, becauſe my Will ſhall be thine. There ſhall be but one Will betwixt us: this hath been the Language of all the Holy Men in Scripture, <hi>Eli, David, Paul:</hi> Let the Lord do as ſeems good to him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.10.2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. This Harmony of Wills is a glorious Fruit of the New Creation; and ſweet and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Character of the New Creature: this brings Serenity to the Soul in all ſtates, when Wind and Tide, go both one way, there's no Storm; ſo when the Chriſtian acquieſceth in God's will, there's great Peace in the Soul.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The laſt Subject, wherein the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is formed in the Affections, theſe are the Motions of the Will, the Will is the [<hi>primum movens</hi> or <hi>mobile</hi>] the main Wheel that carries the Affections along with it: the Affections are either, 1. diſliking; or 2. liking: Averſations or Approbations of theſe Faculties of the Soul, and both of them are reduced to ſweet Order and Harmony, according to Scripture-Rule.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The diſliking or diſapproving Affections, the Stream is quite turned into another Channel, the Soul loaths what it before loved, and bears an implacable hatred, yea, antipathy, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Sin, but <hi>to all appearances of it,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.22. and Avenues that lead to it, or proceed from it, <hi>hating even the Garment ſpotted by the Fleſh,</hi> Jude 23. as one deteſts a Coat with the Plague in it, as a man's Stomach riſeth againſt

The New Creature makes the Chriſtian not only angry at Sin, as againſt his Intereſt, or as a Man may be with his Wife or Child, in a fit of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and entertains good Thoughts of them again, when the Paſſion is over; but there's an implacable Enmity commenced in the Heart againſt all Sin, yea, there's an hatred of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mens perſons for their Sin's ſake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.21, 22. which otherwiſe the Soul loves, as he would not hate the Devil but for Sin: O, how weary am I of this Body of Death, I know not how to bear it, its like a ſtinking dead Carcaſe, that at once both burdens me with its weight, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. and poyſons me with its ſtink: 'Tis this, and this alone that makes me ſend forth [<hi>quotidianos mutigus</hi>] daily groans, and Mournings. Oh that I could put a Bill of Divorce into the Hands of my deareſt Luſt, never to meddle with it again: I will never be reconciled to Sin more; I will cut off my Right hand-Sin, and run the Knife of the Law into the very Heart of my deareſt Luſts: I will ſtudy their utter extirpation: I am <hi>aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face to God,</hi> Ezra 9.6. becauſe of my Spots of guilt and filth; never did any thing lie ſo near my Heart, as my Sin againſt God, <hi>I will

Though I have patience to bear any Affliction: I <hi>behold tranſgreſſors, and am grieved,</hi> Pſal. 119.58, 136. and ſhed many Tears for the diſhonour they bring to my God: Oh that Sin were baniſh'd out of the World, or my Soul withdrawn from the wicked world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the liking Affections, the renewed Soul can truly ſay, as <hi>David, I have ſet my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to the houſe of my God,</hi> 2 Chron. 30.3. As to inferior Objects, my Soul is as a weaned Child, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13 1.12. New light begets new love, new deſires new delights: Truth in the Underſtanding, darting upon the Affections, contracted in the Glaſs of Meditation, inflames the Soul: Did not <hi>our Hearts burn within us, while he opened to us the Scriptures?</hi> Luk. 24.32.

Oh how the good Soul is raviſhed, and tranſported in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries of Love! the Pleaſures of the Soul are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond the Pleaſures of Senſe.</p>
               <p>Oh then, Chriſtian, feel how the Pulſe of thy Soul beats in a conſtant motion: is thy Heart working God-wards in Duties of God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in daily Converſe: which way tends the bent of thy Soul? Art thou truly troubled, that thou canſt <hi>not delight thy ſelf in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 37.4. as thou oughteſt? Would thou give all the World that thou hadſt but an Heart to love God more? Canſt thou ſay as <hi>Peter, Lord thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> Joh 21.15-17. A Flame may be painted, but a paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Flame cannot be felt: I find the workings of Love kindled in my Boſom, if I know any thing of my Heart: and I have ſearched the Characters of true Love in the Scriptures, and I find my Heart ecchoing thereto, harmonizing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and I am told, that this Love is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Character of this New Creature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural with, ingraven in the New Nature,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:37116:76"/>for <hi>he that dwells in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 John 4.16.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Preparatives to, and parts of this New Creature; I proceed briefly to the</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Third Head,</hi> which is the Properties of this New Creature: and they are theſe Seven.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is an univerſal New Creature, it's not in part of the Soul, but runs through the whole <hi>man, ſoul, body and ſpirit,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.23 It's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and comprehenſive, takes in all Internal Powers, External Members, all Acts in all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, at all times, in all employments; as in the Law, the whole Sacrifice was to be offered to God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.9. So it is not acceptable to God if any part be with-held from God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. This New Creature <hi>is as Leaven that runs through the whole lump,</hi> Matth. 13.33. and puts a gracious Tincture into all the Faculties: This is not a Limb or Member, but a whole New Man; yea, the Chriſtian is a perfect man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all the parts of a Saint, though defective in point of degree: our heavenly Father begets no Blind, Lame, Mad, or Maimed Children; there's no Idiots in his Family: A Chriſtian indeed hath all Graces radically; but the Hypocrite is mainly defective in ſomething eſſentially, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to make up a Saint; he is a Cake half baked, Dough on one ſide, <hi>the Legs of the Lame are not equal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a vital, ſelf-moving New Creature, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. Its true, it is hid from outward Obſervation, as the Spring that moves the viſible Hand, for <hi>our Life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. But a vital
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:37116:77"/>Principle it is: this gracious habit is to the Soul as the Soul is to the Body; it's a <hi>ſpark</hi> of <hi>divine Life</hi> kindled by the holy Spirit, a <hi>Seed of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.9. quickned within the Womb of the Earth by the influence of Heaven, putting forth gracious Acts, precious Fruits, by excitations of aſſiſting Grace, after a nipping winter of Temptations or cold Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of Spiritual Decays: <hi>his Spirit makes him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</hi> Oh, ſaith the Chriſtian, I am reſtleſs, as a Bird out of the Neſt, or a Fiſh out of its proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water, unſatisfied till I return to my God. But the Hypocrite is but like a Pupper dreſt like a Saint, moved by Art, or as a Machin by ſomething outward, which the workman faſtens to it, but not informed by a Soul of its own; ſo its at laſt worn or broken, and crumbles to nothing: ſo doth the Hypocrite; as one ſaith, There is a vaſt difference betwixt Wool on the Sheep's back, which clipt, will grow again, and the Wool on the Sheep's Skin on the Wolf's back, which grows no more The living Saint ſtill works upwards, the graceleſs Soul is dead, and puts forth no vital acts.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Its a ſenſible new Greature, its not a dead inanimate Log, but of a tender quick ſenſation and can eaſily diſcern what Profits or Prejudiceth it, what helps or hurts it; it groans under what it feels doth make againſt its being or well-being: nothing doth it hurt ſo much as Sin, or what hath a tendency to it: any act of omiſſion or commiſſion, lies heavy upon it, pricks and wounds it, and makes it bleed; hence 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>an heart of Fleſh,</hi> which is a ſoft and ſenſible thing: defects of Grace, inroads of Temptation,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:37116:77"/>intermiſſions of Duty, or worldlineſs, are more laid to heart by the New Creature, then groſs out-breakings of Sin in the Hypocrite: whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it perceives to be anoyance or diſturbance, is a grievous Affliction. Oh, ſaith the Soul, I found at ſuch a time God's withdrawing the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Spirit. I puzzled and bungled in a Duty, and could make nothing of it; Wo is me, what had I done to baniſh my God? I find a weight on me, <hi>and a Sin that eaſily beſets me,</hi> Heb. 12.1. Did I not quench, grieve, reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? was I not ſluggiſh, heartleſs, formal? Lord, forgive me that Sin, and quicken me with thy Grace: The Hypocrite hath none of theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, Soul-exerciſes, Agonies, but runs on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heartleſs Formality, and cuſtomary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; but knows nothing of God's acceſs, and his receſs, coming or going.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is a growing New Creature, it never ſtands at a ſtay; the Godly Man is compared to the Sun, <hi>that ſhineth ſtill brighter to the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18. to <hi>Calves of the ſtall,</hi> Mal. 4.2. that are ſtill growing; as <hi>new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that you may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2, 3. Its the duty of Saints, yea, their property to <hi>grow ſtronger and ſtronger,</hi> Job 17.9. <hi>To perfect holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. For the New Creature helps, eggs on the Child of God to improve his Talents, to uſe God's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means for increaſe, to derive Vertue from Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>he may increaſe with the increaſe of God,</hi> Col. 2.19. This New Creature begets a new Appetite, which in this imperfect ſtate, makes him gape and long after more; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:37116:78"/>he never ſaith he hath enough in this lower World: Its ſaid of the Crocodile [<hi>quamdiu vivit, creſcit</hi>] ſo the Saint, he grows as long as he lives. Oh, ſaith the Soul, I am ſhort, ſtill defective; the greateſt part of what I have attained, is the leaſt part of what I want: Oh that I could be more like God! <hi>be changed into his Image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. I can never be enough like God: this is the cleareſt evidence of the Truth of Grace: a dead Picture will not grow as a living Child, a dead Stake grows not as a living Plant: Lord make me more humble, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heavenly, ſelf-denying, watchful, fruitful.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a depending New Creature, it makes the Soul ſenſible of its own weakneſs, it feels not its own Feet, it cannot ſtand alone, therefore <hi>leans on its Beloved,</hi> Cant. 8.5. every ſtep through this Wilderneſs ſtate: Wo be to me, ſaith the Soul, if I be alone, I have long found it by too dear-bought Experience: I am like a Staff, and ſhall ſtand no longer then I am upheld by an Almighty Hand; if God bid me come upon the fluid Waves, and reach out his Hand, I will venture, as <hi>Peter,</hi> my Feet ſhall not fail, if Faith fail not: Lord, <hi>hold up my goings in thy path, that my Foot-ſteps ſlip not,</hi> Pſal. 17.5. Alas, <hi>without thee I can do nothing,</hi> John 5.5. But by thee I can <hi>run through a Troop,</hi> and by my God <hi>I can leap over a Wall,</hi> Pſal. 18.29. I am able <hi>to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> Phil. 4.13. I find by experience, that the leaſt difficulty overmatcheth me without divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and the <hi>greateſt Mountains become a plain before Zerubabel.</hi> My Lord of Hoſts, who out
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37116:78"/>of weakneſs can make ſtrong; if he ſay, <hi>My Grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.7. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and in the Name of the Lord do wonders: my only Strength is in thine all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient Grace: <hi>by the Grace of God I am what I am,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. do what I do.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Its a wakeful New Creature; the Soul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſleeps: Grace in the Soul is ſtill waking, <hi>I ſleep, but my Heart wakes,</hi> Cant. 5.2. The wiſe Virgins as well as the fooliſh may take a Nod, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.6, 7. But they are quickly awak'd with the Bridegroom's coming: Grace may lie in the dull habit, or as a Spark of Fire in the Aſhes, but it will revive: there needs not a new Life to be put in, but a ſtirring up that vital Principle: it may ſeem a Paradox that the Chriſtian is diſtinguiſhed from his Heart: a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the Actings of ſpiritual Livelineſs and Vivacity there may be, whereby the Senſes are at preſent bound up, by indiſpoſition to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, yet a Principle of Grace, inclining to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there may be; thus there's two different Natures in the Child of God, like two diſtinct Perſons; ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.20. If <hi>I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but ſin that dwelleth in me.</hi> So he diſtinguiſheth oft betwixt I and I: theſe different Natures have oppoſite Actings: in the worſt ſtate of a Chriſtian's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual dulneſs, he is very apprehenſive things are not right with him; there's ſome Convictions, Challenges, Purpoſes, Proteſtations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man againſt this lazy frame, it diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him, and he hath ſome faint and languid Struglings to raiſe himſelf: The New Creature gives not full conſent, though it can act little
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37116:79"/>vigorouſly, but ther's <hi>a luſting againſt each other,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith did not act, yet not totally fail, when he denyed his Maſter: For Chriſt's Prayer was heard for him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. There is ſome tendency in the Heart God-wards in the Saints loweſt Ebbs: he's not ſatisfied in his Sleepineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is an abiding New Creature, it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main and overcome all Oppoſitions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as the Soul continues, as was ſaid before, it is an immortal Seed, <hi>the world paſſeth away, and the luſt thereof; but he that doth the will of God, abideth for ever,</hi> 1 John 2.17. <hi>This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing abideth in them,</hi> and cauſeth them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in him, ver. 27. This Principle will be as <hi>a well of water ſpringing up into everlaſting Life,</hi> Joh. 4.14. This <hi>fear of the Lord endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 19.9. His <hi>Righteouſneſs endureth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 112.3. Morality withers and Decays, but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity will run paralel with the Life of God, and Line of Eternity: If thou art an Apoſtate, thou waſt never ſuch a New Creature, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: If <hi>you continue in my Word, then are you my Diſciples indeed,</hi> John 8.31. Look you to your Sincerity, and God will look to your Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; nay, that Principle will be attended with an holy Jealouſie, which is the aw-band of the Soul, and a ſpecial Preſervation againſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their Hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> This Fear will teach them to incline God-wards, and abhor what tends to departing from God: Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes this a clear evidence of a ſtate o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the firſt Step and higheſt Round in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Ladder; hath thy ſoul ſo far learned it, as to makes God's glory, communion with him the chief aim of thy Duties, Studies, Endeavours: canſt thou, ſoul, throw thy ſelf in the Duſt, that God may be on the Throne; diſappear, that God may only be ſeen, as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe,</hi> John 3.30. If any good be done, <hi>its not I, but the grace of God with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. Let him alone have the glory: let the Crown be ſet no where but

Oh now, if you could lay your Ear to the Cloſet of this new born Saint; what ſighs and groans would you hear? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26.

To improve their natural Faculties to the utmoſt, in order to the attaining of this End: I ſhall but briefly lay before you what a natural man can do, by the help of common Providence, and what he muſt do, as he will anſwer the contrary another day, to that God that hath given him a Command, and rational Faculties capable of compliance.</p>

Natural Conſcience even of <hi>Heathens,</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſomething of theſe grand Principles; for ſo ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, 15. That <hi>though the</hi> Gentiles <hi>have not the written Law before their Eyes,</hi> yet they have a tranſcript thereof in their Hearts, which declares to them ſome Good and Evil, and Conſcience <hi>according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſeth</hi> them if they do well, and <hi>accuſeth them if they do evil,</hi> Rom. 1.18, 24.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37116:88"/>to be without excuſe: and can we think that Men now diſclaiming and obliterating theſe notices of Religion will fare better? Surely no: So on the contrary, the way to obtain more, is to improve what we have: I ſay, not that God is bound to give ſpecial Grace to ſuch as improve common, but an inſtance can hardly be produced to the contrary: and this is God's method in vouchſafing his Grace, to engage Souls to cheriſh and excite moral Principles by diligent endeavours, which God uſually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds with his bleſſing; yea, this courſe doth naturally tend to weaken vicious Inclinations: Set your ſelves about this work, and you little know what it may come to at the laſt.

               <head>Chap. XIII. <hi>Inſtructions, how thoſe muſt behave themſelves that are indeed New Creatures.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Third Head to be inſiſted upon in this Uſe of Inſtruction, is to direct ſincere Chriſtians that do find by good proof, that this New Creature is wrought in them, how they ſhould live, walk, and behave themſelves in the World, both towards God and Man.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Uſe God's appointed means for clearing up the reality of this New Creature: it's one thing to be, another thing to know that we are New Creatures: Alas, ſome ſincere Souls walk at Uncertainties. A Letter may be written, ſaith one, though it be not ſealed: So Grace may be writ in the Soul, though the Spirit hath not ſet to its Seal: partly to keep the Soul humble, partly to puniſh ſome Sin: But I muſt not handle the common place of Aſſurance, the poſſibility, the hindrances, helps, advantages, nature or kinds of Aſſurance; but give an hint. Are the Figures of Grace ingraven upon the Dial of your Hearts, pray and wait for the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhining on it, that you may better ſee what time of day it is in your Hearts: yet if you grope in the dark, you may feel ſome Characters engraven: <hi>however, give diligence to make first your Calling, then your Election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.10. Your happineſs conſiſts in being, and your comfort in knowing you are New Creatures. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.10. <hi>And we deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full aſſurance of hope to the end.</hi> Another Text calls for <hi>a full aſſurance of Faith in drawing nigh to God,</hi> Heb. 10.22. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:37116:94"/>ſpeaks of <hi>Aſſurance of underſtanding;</hi> yea, full Aſſurance, yea, <hi>Riches of full aſſurance,</hi> Col. 2.2. Then indeed thy Heart will be comforted to the purpoſe: O labour after much Grace, much Comfort, or <hi>the joy of the Lord is your strength,</hi> Neh. 8.10. and will chear up your Hearts in every condition and affliction. O Brethren, content not your ſelves to live at Uncertainties, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Doubts, but uſe all means to attain to the higheſt pitch of Aſſurance that is attainable in this world.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thank God for this rich mercy of the New Creation in your Souls: will you bleſs God for the good Creatures that nouriſh your Bodies, and will you not adore him for this new, and more excellent Creature in your inward man? Say as the bleſſed Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again to a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Christ from the Dead.</hi> Next to Chriſt's bleſſed Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings for you, this is the greateſt mercy God vouchſafed to you, to form Chriſt in your Souls: Alas, what were you better then the reſt of the corrupt Maſs of Mankind, that lay in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure of Sin? What deſert was there in you, that you ſhould be raiſed up to ſit with Princes, even with the Princes of his People, to be made like Angels: Surely you that are ſuch Patterns of Mercy, muſt be Trumpets of God's Praiſe, you that were ſtinking Carcaſes, incarnate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, to be made by this New Creation <hi>a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſthood, an holy Nation, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People; what is this for, but that you ſhould
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:37116:94"/>ſhew forth the Praiſes of him who hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvelous Light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. O admire free Grace, and ſay with <hi>David, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my Houſe that thou haſt brought me hitherto,</hi> 2 Sam. 7.18. How many Millions of pretending Chriſtians know nothing of this great Work, experimentally: this is as Life from the Dead, infinitely better then natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life, and all the comforts there of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Take heed of declining or Apoſtaſy; The New Creature is but a Creature, it may fail, yea, it will fail, if not ſupported by an Almighty Hand, and if God be provoked, he may juſtly withdraw, and leave us to our ſelves: then we fall, as a Staff ſupported by an Hand: its true, the Covenant ſecures real Saints from falling finally, but imperfect Grace expoſeth them to falling foully, as <hi>David, Peter:</hi> Be jealous of thy ſelf, <hi>Bleſſed is he that feareth always,</hi> Prov. 28.14. Be not ſecure, that expoſeth to Satan's Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: Sleep levels all, the Wiſe Man is no wiſer then a Fool to project his own ſafety; or the Strong Man better than the Weak to defend himſelf: the beſt of Saints in Spiritual Slumber, becomes as <hi>Sampſon,</hi> but like another man: <hi>watch, that you enter not into Temptation,</hi> Matth. 26.41. It's worth watching to keep the Houſe from Robbing: Sleeping one Night, may keep thee waking many Nights in Sorrow, as it did <hi>David:</hi> The ſleepy Chriſtian oft loſeth God's Preſence, as Chriſt withdrew from the ſleepy Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.2, 4. A ſleepy Soul is not capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving Chriſt or Grace: put the ſweeteſt Wine in a ſleepy Man's Hand, it will be ſpilt: And
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:37116:95"/>if at any time you take a Nap, rouze up your ſelves, gird on your Armour, rally your rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forces: <hi>Remember whence you are fallen, repent, do your firſt Works,</hi> Rev. 2.5. Awake out of your Lethargy, leſt it end in Apoſtaſy: when thou haſt fallen, ſhew this New Creature is in thee by a rebound upwards, in renewed Purpoſes againſt Sin, recover thy Spiritual ſtrength, activity and familiarity with God; be reſtleſs till Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be ſet right again, like a Bird from its Neſt, a Stone from its Center, or as undigeſted Meat on a ſick Stomach, that hath no eaſe till Sin be pickt up by a Vomit of Repentance; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed Acts of Faith: <hi>Look to your ſelves, that we loſe not thoſe things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward,</hi> 2 John 8.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Get this New Creature increaſed: be not content with the habit: if you ſay you have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, you have no Grace: your buſineſs is to <hi>perfect Holineſs in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. To grow in Grace, that <hi>you may be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.18. 2 Tim. 2.1. Dead things grow not: Children grow, and are fed by that by which they were bred, as <hi>new born Babes, deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word,</hi> that <hi>you may grow thereby,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.2. Be often ſucking the Breaſts, and you will grow up to further maturity. There is, ſaith one, much Scurf on the Face of this new born Babe of Grace, which by degrees will wear off as it grows up, and ſo be more diſcernable: growth helps to ſee its truth: blow up this Spark into a Flame, and it will be viſible: An Hypocrite grows not, no more than the Hands, Arms,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37116:95"/>Legs of a pictured Child on the Wall, let it be there never ſo long. Oh, ſtrive to grow every day better, <hi>to grow from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 84.7. reaching after Perfection in Grace; to <hi>run the Race ſet before you:</hi> to get daily more power againſt Corruption: He is a careful and skilful Phyſician that evacuates the Diſeaſe, and corroborates or ſtrengthens the Body: you muſt do both: the Old Man and New Creature, are like Weights in Ballances, as the one aſcends, the other deſcends: as the Earth and Sea, where the one loſeth, the other gaineth: Oh, be ſtill on the gaining Hand, improve all Mercies, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, Ordinances, Providences, for nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this New Creature in your Souls: when you are grown moſt, you will ſtill be defective, ſomething <hi>will ſtill be lacking in your Faith,</hi> Love, Humility, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. You know but in part, and are not yet ripe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Live up to this New Creature, live at the rate of Perſons ſo principled, <hi>walk worthy of God, who hath called you into his Kingdom and glory, worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called,</hi> 1 Theſ 2.12. <hi>Let your Converſation be as becometh the Goſpel,</hi> Eph. 4.1. Phil. 1.27. There's an <hi>Only</hi> upon this, as a moſt comprehenſive Word: you muſt act above the rate of carnal men, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, Righteouſly, Godly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. If you be ſingled out to be New Creatures, <hi>what ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar thing do you?</hi> Matth. 5.47. What do you more then others? Remember, Sirs, you are New Creatures; an old Heart would have ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved well enough to have done the Devil's drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery withal: you are new born to higher Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37116:96"/>now you <hi>muſt ſerve not in the oldneſs of the Letter, but in the newneſs of the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 7.6. When the Temple was built with ſuch curious Care, and coſtly Materials, ſurely it was for Holy Uſe? Sincere Chriſtians are God's <hi>workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. Now it becomes you to act as you are: it would accent your Sin with a greater Circumflex, if you ſin, that have ſuch a curious Work of the Spirit in your Hearts, as none in the World-have beſides you: you are conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſons, and by your Sin you prophane God's Temple; other's Sins are Theft, your's Sacrilege, becauſe you rob God of what was devoted to him: when God breathed ſuch a noble Soul into Man's Body, he deſigned him for higher Acts then meerly Senſe, as Beaſts, or to converſe with Beaſts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. So Chriſtian, thou art of an higher extraction, then to walk as Men, as carnal Men; no, Friend, as thou <hi>haſt received Chriſt, ſo thou muſt walk in him,</hi> Col. 2.6. O take heed of Sin, it's contrary to the Divine Nature God hath planted in thee; now we know the more unnatural any Act is, the more horrid: as for a Woman to kill her own Child, or a Man to be cruel to his own Fleſh: Oh take heed of Killing the Babe of Grace in thy Soul, by Sin; but live up to the Principles and Privileges.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Attend upon God in all his Inſtitutions, and in all put forward for cloſer communion with him in all Duties and Ordinances, as in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, Prayer, Seals of the Covenant, Chriſtian Conference, Communion of Saints: theſe are the Air that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> breathes in; the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:37116:96"/>moſt wholſom for this New Creature, <hi>Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy Houſe, and the place where thine Honour dwells,</hi> Pſal. 26.8. And he often cries out for the Living God; <hi>Oh when,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall I come and appear before God?</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing lies nearer <hi>David</hi>'s holy Heart then God's preſence in his Ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.63, 1, 2.84.1, 2. It is or ſhould be ſo with the New Creature: but oh wait for the Spirit's wafting over thy Soul to Jeſus: reſt not in Ordinances, they are but the Boat or Bridge to carry thy Soul over to God: the Ordinance is loſt, and thy labour is in vain if thou do not enjoy God in Ordinances. O labour to ſee Chriſt <hi>walking in the midſt of the golden Candleſticks,</hi> Rev. 2.1 Be ſure you <hi>hold Chriſt in the Galleries,</hi> Cant. 7.5. Ordinances are <hi>the golden Pipes that empty the golden Oyl out of themſelves,</hi> Zech. 4. Be ſure <hi>that of his fulneſs you receive, and Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. The Holy Ghoſt ſits in Ordinances as a Miniſter of State in his Office, ready to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to every ones caſe as there is need: thou art at the right Door, wait his leiſure, and it ſhall not be in vain.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Endeavour to propagate Religion, do what thou canſt to make others new Creatures, thy Relations, Neighbours, and all thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: this is the Duty, yea, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the new Creature by Prayer, Advice, Example, procuring the help of Miniſters, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Friends: 'tis true, no man can propagate Grace to another, it's not in our own power to effect it, but we muſt endeavour it: Oh how <hi>Paul</hi> was concern'd for his Country-men the wilful
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:37116:97"/>unbelieving <hi>Jews, Rom.</hi> 9.10. His Prayers, Tears, Wiſhes, ſpeak him their cordial Friend, who were his bitter Enemies. God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham</hi> that all his Houſe ſhould be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, to have him go as far as he could to draw them into affinity with God: true Grace makes men love Relations better than ever, and cauſeth natural Affection to run in a ſpiritual Channel, which vents it ſelf for the good of their Souls: Be concerned to make a Joynture of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, to thy VVife, an entail of the Covenant to thy Children: this is a thouſand times better then leaving them thouſands a Year: Should not you deſire that one Heaven may hold thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, that one Houſe hold now? Oh tremble to think when your Houſe breaks up, of one going to Heaven, another to Hell: and let your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity extend it ſelf to all you are acquainted with, and let your Practices be convincing and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all about you: Alas, what multitudes are there that are unexperienced in this mighty work, yet muſt feel it, or never be happy: do what thou canſt to call in all to this bleſſed Feaſt, <hi>yet there's room,</hi> Luk. 14.22. Haſt thou none thou loveſt ſo well as to wiſh them thy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? There's no Envy in Spiritual things, the more and merrier, and no leſs chear: it will add ſome Pearls to thy Crown to win Souls: If a Neighbour lock'd himſelf in a Room on de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to murder himſelf, wouldſt thou not break open the Door and reſcue him? Oh happy Souls that are imployed and ſucceſsful in this Soul-Charity!</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:37116:97"/>
               <p>I have long ago, ſeen a Book writ by Mr. <hi>Reiner</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> called, <hi>The Rule of the New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> to which I refer the Reader that can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it; at preſent I ſhall ſumm up my thoughts in theſe Twenty brief Rules of Direction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reaſon right, and Reckon ſtreight: let your Reaſon be regulated by the Word of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.21.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. It muſt follow Faith, not give Law and meaſure to it: be ſure your Accounts be ſquared by the Golden Rule of Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. Set all ſtreight againſt the Reckoning Day, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Baulk no Sufferings for Chriſt, to avoid ſin againſt Chriſt: Be content to fill up Chriſt's Sufferings, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.24. Nay, be glad to ſuffer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.11. But tremble to ſin: Sinleſs ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are ſweet, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. But ſweet ſins will be Bitterneſs in the end, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. Bear any thing but Sin.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Profeſs what you are, and be what you profeſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.32, 33. Think not to diſſemble with Men, for worldly Ends: but upon a juſt Cauſe and Call, own Godlineſs: be indeed <hi>Nathaniels, John</hi> 1.47. Pretend not more then truth: God knows the Heart, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Serve God for Service, not for Wages: or rather, let his Service be your Wages, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.11. or reward, ſo it is, <hi>God himſelf is the Saints reward,</hi> Gen. 17.1. Hypocrites make Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a Mount to aſcend to ſome other End: let God be thy all, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:37116:98"/>
               <p n="5">5. Be moſt for God, when God ſeems moſt againſt thee: its pure Faith and Love to hang cloſeſt to an angry God, <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. To conceive moſt hopes through Chriſt, when Senſe and Reaſon make againſt you, this is a Faith to be admired, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.28.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Joyn pure Precepts to precious Promiſes: look on Precepts as pure, therefore lovely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.140. Dare not to divorce them, though for your Spiritual Intereſt: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.12, 14, 22. See to the Law within you, and before you, as well as plead the Promiſes of the Goſpel for you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be beſt when leaſt in Mens ſight: God and Souls <hi>give each other their Loves,</hi> when alone, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.25. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.6. Make God your Witneſs; not Men only: Friends are moſt familiar when they are withdrawn from all other Company.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Sail low, but aim high; conclude you have not attained to Perfection, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.13, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. but ſtill be deſigning it, be not high-minded, yet mind higheſt things; aſpire to be better then others, yet <hi>eſteem others better than you,</hi> Phil. 2.3, 4.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Do all you muſt, not all you may, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15.1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. walk to the height of a Command, not to the utmoſt of lawful liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; go not near the Pit's brink, ſtand faſt in your Chriſtian liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.1, 13. but do not always uſe it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Be beſt when others are worſt: be as <hi>Noah</hi> in the Old World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.9, 19. <hi>Lot</hi> in
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37116:98"/>
                  <hi>Sodom, Timothy</hi> in <hi>Epheſus, Joſhua</hi> among the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> be hotteſt in coldeſt Weather, bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the darkeſt Night, Savour of Heaven in Hell, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.20-5.15. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Be Rational, when moſt Spiritual: do nothing at hap-hazard, or with a blind Zeal, let all Services be reaſonable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. God's Will is our Rule, and his ways are equal, the higheſt Reaſon in Man, is to comply with God's pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Naturalize Religion, and Spiritualize the World: let Godlineſs be as ſecond nature, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.20. Let common Objects, Occurrences be well improved to good Ends and Purpoſes: Mercies, Afflictions, Spiritual Chymiſts turn all to Gold, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Be dead living, and lively in thoughts of Death, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. A Child of God is a Paradox, dead to the World, crucified, yet the moſt active and vigorous Perſon in the World: you muſt have the beſt Death and beſt Life, then fear not Death.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Suit Grace to every caſe; in confeſſing Sin, mourn, in begging Mercy, working De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, in Thanksgiving, Joyfulneſs, yet <hi>rejoyce with trembling,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.30, 55. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.18. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.12. in Proſperity, have Humility, in Adverſity, Contentment, your Foot muſt ſtill ſtand in an even place.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Let your life be a Comment on your Faith: let your believing and living be harmonious: let Doctrine of Faith, Grace of Faith, Life of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:37116:99"/>Faith, ſweetly correſpond, <hi>Doctrine according to Godlineſs, Godlineſs according to Truth,</hi> James 2.18. 1 Tim. 1.5. Tit. 1.1. Rom. 2.18, 23, 24. Jer. 32.19. Let not Head and Hands be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Eye God that eyes you in all you do: think the King of Heaven ſees thee, the Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipreſent God is in the room with thee, the Omniſcient God knows thy Heart, approve thy Heart to God, let thine Eyes be ever on him, towards him, <hi>Pſal</hi> 35.15.26, 3.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Eccho to divine Calls, when God hath a Mouth to ſpeak, have an Ear, Tongue, ſay, Here I am. Word or Rod, a call to Duty, from Sin; what's the meaning of this? Oh that I could attain God's end, and not reſiſt or <hi>quench the holy Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.8. <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.9. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Obſerve and make up daily decays, keep up your Watch that you ſin not, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41.1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. But if you ſin, lie not in it, but riſe, mourn, act Faith on Chriſt, your great Advocate, let not an ill matter go on quickly, recover your firſt Love, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Give no Offence careleſly, and take no Offence cauſleſly: let there be <hi>no occaſion of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in you,</hi> 1 John 2.10. Matth. 7.1. Judge not uncharitably, take all that's ſaid and done by the right handle: make no ſiniſter Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.32.</p>
               <p n="20">20. When you have done all, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.7, 8. Say, all this is as nothing at all, to appeaſe God's Wrath, or ſatisfie Juſtice, in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:37116:99"/>an abſolute Senſe, and to do what's required in a comparative ſenſe, <hi>without Chriſt I can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> John 15.5.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have hinted at this before, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, you muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive ſenſe of a change in Heart and Life, and a due apprehenſion of this change morally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as Saving; many a Soul can truly ſay, ſomething hath been done, but I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the thing which may be entituled <hi>A New Creature;</hi> I am much in the dark about it: I cannot but ſay I have had Convictions, and ſomething like Converſion, though not Conſolation: I am kept ſtill in innitency upon a Promiſe, though I cannot ſay I have aſſurance of my Intereſt in the Covenant. Precious Mr. <hi>Paul Bains</hi> could ſay, <hi>Suſtentation I have, but Suavities Spiritual I do
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37116:100"/>not experience.</hi> So you may have the Root, though not the Flower; VVater of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not the Oyl of Gladneſs: wait on God, and in due time you may have this clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to you: If <hi>you follow on to know the Lord, his going forth is prepared as the Morning, Hoſ.</hi> 6.3. Grace and Peace ſhall not be long parted: <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Joy for the upright in Heart,</hi> Pſal. 97.11. It's not loſt, but laid up and hid in the Furrows of the Believer's Boſom.</p>
               <p>2d. Caſe. <hi>Whether is it poſſible that he that's a New Creature, ſhould have a ſelf-accuſing, ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Conſcience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> You muſt diſtinguiſh of Conſciences condemning a man's ſelf; 1. Paſſively, when our Hearts cenſure us, and we ſtifle them, ſuch a one indeed is ſelf-condemned: 2. If we be Active in condemning our ſelves; it's a good Sign, and a great Duty; as we ſhewed before: but the meaning of this Query, refers to the State of the Man, whether the Conſcience of a New Creature may cenſure the real Chriſtian, and tell him he is an Hypocrite. To which I Anſwer, If Conſcience act according to the Rule of the VVord, it muſt be regarded as God's Officer, ſpeaking by his authority; but if it ſpeak not in God's Name, and by his order, we may appeal to the Higher Court of the Holy Scriptures, and it's certain that Conſcience may be corrupted, and it is often uſed by Satan, to deceive good Men as well as bad: and they ſhall at laſt have their action againſt Satan for falſe Impriſonment, and diſturbing their Peace:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37116:100"/>Your beſt courſe therefore is to have recourſe to the VVord, for Conſcience is but an under Officer, and muſt be accountable for its Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Remember, it's one thing to have Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie in thy Heart, another thing to be an Hypocrite: the beſt will find much Guilt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, which Conſcience rebukes them for, and they bewail it; but they are not therefore Hypocrites.</p>
               <p>3d. Caſe. <hi>Whether may God carry it ſtrangely, as if he were an Enemy to a New Creature, that ſhould ſeem to be his darling?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou art a Stranger to Scripture, and the Experiences of all God's Children, if thou think God muſt always be dandling this New Creature on his Knee, or giving it the Kiſſes of his Mouth; no, no, he hath reſerved theſe Sweat-meats for the upper Table in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: there's great reaſon thou ſhould have his Frowns, as well as Smiles, to humble thy Heart, exerciſe thy Graces, diſcover the neceſſity of Chriſt, the deſireableneſs of Heaven: God can and may, without any impediment to his Love, hide it for a ſeaſon from his own deareſt Child: <hi>David</hi> indeed called in queſtion God's Love and Faithfulneſs, when he hid his Face; but at laſt, he found that it was his Infirmity, and doubtleſs, lamented it as his Sin: God hath given abundant Security in his Promiſes of his Love without preſent ſenſe: you muſt not think much at him, if he do not come to viſit you, and take you up in his Arms as oft as you would have him: Thou needſt ſome purging Phyſick
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37116:101"/>as well as Cordials: a Son may need a Frown, as well as a Smile from his Father: God is a free Agent, his Kiſſes are his own: but its well thou art ſo ſenſible of his Acceſs and Receſs, his Smiles and Frowns: it's a ſign of ſome Spiritual Life in thy Soul.</p>
               <p>4th Caſe. <hi>But you ſaid the New Creature grows; I find it otherwiſe, I cannot ſee that I grow in Grace, nay, I decline and go backwards, what think you of that?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> As the Chriſtian grows in Grace, ſo he grows in Light to diſcover his ſtate, and ſees more vileneſs in himſelf, and is ſtill more ſenſible of decays in Grace, which keeps him humble, ſelf-denying and vile in his own Eyes, that's growth too, bleſs God for it: but obſerve it, grains of allowance muſt be given to Old Age, when natural parts decay, and Perſons may not be ſo quick and lively as formerly, yet may be more ſolid and increaſing in Experiences. Mr. <hi>Greenham</hi> ſaid, <hi>It's an hard and rare thing to keep up young Zeal with old Diſcetion.</hi> Doſt thou not keep up a more conſtant courſe of Duty, ſettled Reſolutions for God? Is not thy Heart more deaded to the world, taken up with things unſeen? Art thou not more compoſed under Afflictions? doſt thou not more diſcover and bewail Spiritual Sins? Doſt thou not long more after the good of Relations, take more delight in God's VVord, breathe after more of God's Preſence in Ordinances? Speak out, Man, deal faithfully, bear not falſe witneſs againſt thy ſelf: yet it's true, the growing Tree meets
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:37116:101"/>with a fall of the Leaf, a ſharp Winter; yet doth a Spring come, it grows in the Summer: <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fall was recruited to geater boldneſs for God: but I hope thou art <hi>not a backſlider in Heart,</hi> Prov. 14.14. To diſlike the ways of God: Thou art but <hi>overtaken with a Sin,</hi> againſt thy ſtrong Purpoſes, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. When thou <hi>ſleepeſt, doth not thy Heart wake?</hi> Cant. 5.2. Thou art not pleaſed with this declining ſtate: <hi>Thy Spirit is willing, but thy Fleſh is weak,</hi> Matth. 26.41.</p>
               <p>5th. Caſe. <hi>But alas, I have ſuch ſtrong, impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, yea, imperious workings of Corruption in my Heart, as never any had that hath a principle of Grace: None like me: Is it poſſible I ſhould be a New Creature?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The <hi>Heart knows its own bitterneſs,</hi> and wickedneſs, Prov. 14.10. Every graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soul thinks his own Heart worſt, becauſe he knows it beſt: But who told thee that thy Heart was ſo bad? Was it always thus with thee? Was there not a time that thou thoughteſt thy Heart was as good as any Bodies? Is it not Spiritual Light that makes theſe ſtrange Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries? <hi>Whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is Light,</hi> Eph. 5.13. Did not Sin <hi>revive upon the coming of the Commandment?</hi> Rom. 7.9. But Friend, let me ask thee: Doſt thou think that upon the planting of this New Creature in thy Soul, Sin ſhould be utterly extirpated, that thou ſhouldſt hear no more of it? Doſt thou not find even bleſſed <hi>Paul, groaning ſtill under a Body of Death?</hi> Rom. 7.24. Will not the Fleſh ſtill <hi>luſt againſt the Spirit?</hi> Gal. 5.17. Surely thou knoweſt little of a Chriſtian ſtate, if thou imagineſt a total
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37116:102"/>Immunity from the Body, and Indwelling of Sin in this world: Its well if Sin be not upon the Throne, though thou haſt it in the Field to fight with: the Goſpel-privilege is, <hi>Sin ſhall not have dominion over thee, becauſe thou art under Grace,</hi> Rom. 6.14.</p>
               <p>6th. Caſe. <hi>But what will you ſay by a Man that cannot give a preciſe account of the Time and Manner of the forming of this New Creature in his Heart, that never had ſuch terrors as ſome have?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Will any ſay the River <hi>Nilus</hi> is no River, becauſe men never found out the Head of it? God is a free Agent, and hath different Seaſons and Manners of working: Some were wrought upon in their younger days, and were religiouſly educated, and never ſtept aſide into groſs Sins, and God ſteals in gently upon them, and opens their Hearts as he did <hi>Lydia's Acts</hi> 16.14. and gently attracts them to himſelf, picking the Lock (as it were) without much noiſe; whenas he breaks the Wards in others, with aſtoniſhing Convictions, as he dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> and famous Mr. <hi>Bolton:</hi> Some are of mild and gentle Natures, and God ſees they cannot bear hard blows, which ſome others need, of ſturdy and ſtubborn Spirits: Do not murmur, but thank God that he hath come ſo ſweetly into thy Soul: he knows thy frame and conſtitution: See the Work be there, and a Scriptural work, and leave God to his liberty: But this thou canſt ſay through Grace, it is not with thee now as it hath been, as the blind man ſaid, I may be ignorant of ſome Circumſtances, <hi>But one th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> I know, that whereas I was blind, now
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:37116:102"/>I ſee,</hi> John 9.25. Things are otherwiſe repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to me, and my Spirit working otherwiſe within then formerly: So that I may ſay as <hi>Rebekah</hi> with her Twins in her Womb, <hi>If it be ſo, or not ſo, why am I thus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7th. Caſe. <hi>But alas, no Body knows what a frame of Spirit I have in my Prayers, ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions and Diverſions I have from God, as cannot be conſiſtent with the New Creature in any; what think you?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I ſay, 'tis ſad, that ſuch Vermin ſhould crawl in God's Sanctuary, eſpecially when thou art in God's immediate worſhip: but doſt thou approve of them, and make them wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come? Are they not troubleſome Gueſts? Do they not forcibly aſſault thee, as ſo many unmannerly Gueſts? Suppoſe in your Family as you are kneeling in Prayer, a company of Royſters ſtand under your VVindow, roaring and hollowing, though it diſturb you, would you thence queſtion your Sincerity in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? And 'tis all one, whether the diſturbance be in the Room or in the Boſom, ſince both are diſliked as a burden to thee:
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Tho. Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Treat. of Diſtract.</note> I often reflect on a paſſage I read many Years ago, <hi>The good Lord keep the Hearts of his People under a due ſenſe of their Diſtractions, for they are never like to be rid of them while they live.</hi> Thou doſt reckon thy ſelf to be as in the Belly of Hell with <hi>Jonah,</hi> while thou art yok'd with ſuch thoughts and ſendeſt many a deep groan to Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and at ſomtimes, doſt obtain
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:37116:103"/>ſome help againſt them, and getteſt near thy God in duty.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall add no more of theſe Caſes, but only add two VVords as a Cloſe of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, That if poor doubting Souls would, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their Complainings and Objections, but do theſe two things, it would tend more to their Satisfaction, and the Glory of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That they would ſpend that time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining their own Conſciences, which they take up in fruitleſs Complaints: Alas, many Profeſſors have got an Art of whining and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to Miniſters and Chriſtian Friends, and think to be better thought of for ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; but this is a ſad Judgment of God, for Perſons to <hi>pine away in their Iniquity, and yet mourn one towards another,</hi> Ezek. 24.23. If poor Souls would ſpend that time in ſearching their own Conſciences and Converſations, it would tend more to the clearing up the Sincerity of their Hearts, and Saving Work of Grace: Fall to this, Sirs, enter into your Cloſets, commune with your own Hearts, deal faithfully and effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; put not off your ſelves with unproved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits and groundleſs Imaginations, but go through-ſtitch with the Work; ranſak your Hearts, they are your own; be not put off with ſuch mannerly Excuſes as <hi>Rachel</hi>'s: Take ſuch an Account as you muſt give to God: let no luſt eſcape your view, or the leaſt Grace be belyed or denyed with any ſcorn or diſregard: When <hi>David thought of God, he was troubled,</hi> and expreſſeth many diſcontented Murmurings;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:37116:103"/>but when <hi>he communed with his own Heart,</hi> Pſal. 77.36, 40. he clears God, and condemns his Unbelief; indites the Thief, and clears his Conſcience of that troubleſome <hi>Jonah</hi> in his Boſome: Thus plaindealing evidenceth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's State ſooner then wrangling: and yet ſtill thou art at a loſs: Appeal to God, and ſay as <hi>Job, Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked,</hi> Job 10.7. Or as <hi>Peter, Thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> John 21.15. Or as <hi>David, Do not I hate them that hate thee? Search me, O God, and know my Heart,</hi> Pſal. 139.21, 23. As wiſe Phyſicians, truſt not their own Judgment about their own Health; ſo the Saint knows God's Line reacheth lower then his own, and to his Judgment he will ſtand.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Inſtead of complaining, fall vigorouſly upon the work of Sanctification, to mortifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Luſts, <hi>to cut off a right Hand, and pluck out a right Eye,</hi> Matth. 5.29. When you have ſearch'd out the Leaven, purge it out, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. Lay aſide <hi>every Weight, and the Sin which doth moſt eaſily beſet you,</hi> Heb. 12.1. Run the Sword of the Spirit to the Heart of every Luſt: <hi>Lay the Ax to the root of the Tree,</hi> ſtub up Sin by the Roots: if a vain Thought, a proud, luſtful, worldly, paſſionate Thought ariſe in your Hearts, ſuppreſs it, militate againſt it, <hi>crucifie the Fleſh, with the Affections and Lusts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. So will you evidence your ſelves to be Chriſt's, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. be daily <hi>perfecting Holineſs in the fear of God.</hi> Obſerve wherein you miſſed it in ſuch a Duty, and be ſtill mending it, as <hi>Apelles,</hi> when he had drawn a Picture, was
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37116:104"/>ever and anon ſpying Defects, and then mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with his Pencil: ſo do you. Obſerve what Conſcience ſaid, Oh my Soul, in ſuch a Duty thou waſt cold, diſtracted, unbelieving, hard, vain-glorious, in ſuch an Affliction thou waſt froward, peeviſh, diſcontented, in ſuch a company thou ſpakeſt idlely, or waſt guilty of ſinful ſilence: In the enjoyment of ſuch a Mercy, or in thy poſperous ſtate, how proud, ſecure, ſelf-conceited, ſlighting others, waſt thou? Oh mourn for this Fault, watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it for the future: walk more cloſely with God, maintain daily Intercourſe with God and thine own Conſcience: thereby you will be better acquainted with God and your own Souls, and diſcern better how your Principles are ſtated; <hi>For if you walk ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Rule, Peace ſhall be upon you,</hi> Gal. 6.16. Hence the bleſſed Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>For our rejoycing is this, the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in Simplicity and Godly Sincerity, not in fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Converſation in the World.</hi> Dying <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> could plead this with God in his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.1.</p>

If you walk as he walked, you evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37116:104"/>that you abide in him: as he <hi>which hath called you is holy,</hi> ſo be <hi>ye holy in all manner of Converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.15. If you expect that God's Spirit will witneſs with your Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and ſo ſubſcribe your Certificate for Heaven; you muſt be uniform, and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal in your courſe of Godlineſs, both in your Worſhip and Walking, walking before God, and with God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5.24-17.1. Then indeed will you be found upright or perfect: But if thou have any cloſe Box in the Cabinet of thy Heart, wherein thou layeſt up and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt any beloved Luſt; or if thou royleſt theſe Waters by any uneven walking, or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt thy Travels in Heaven's Road, by idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſleeping, or ſtepping back, and loſing thy firſt Love, then no wonder if thou canſt not diſcern this Stamp of God's Image upon thy Soul, but calleſt thy very ſtate into queſtion.</p>
               <p>Yet above all, I adviſe thee to ſtop the Mouth of Conſcience, with that only that ſatisfied the Juſtice of God: Nothing can reconcile a Man to himſelf, but that which reconciled God and Man.</p>
               <p>It was Dr. <hi>Sibs</hi> Advice, When the Water of Sanctification runs muddy, betake your ſelves to the Blood of Juſtification: There, there muſt lie your Comfort, and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by this only muſt you anſwer all the Objections raiſed by Satan and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, from Juſtice, Law, or whatſoever
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37116:105"/>oppoſeth your Peace, riſing from the Defects and Imperfections of Grace, or this New Creature within you: And indeed, the beſt of us muſt anchor and center here, as to out Juſtification, Acceptation with God, or compoſedneſs of Conſcience.</p>
               <p>Come then, let us go (in this Goſpel-way) to Jeſus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things then that of <hi>Abel, Heb.</hi> 12.24. <hi>
